stalk that 'capers gradually almost into a twig; it is
heaped with very closely packed grains, with a corymb
that is at its longest a foot in length. In millet
the hairs embracing the seed curve over with 3
fringed tuft. There are also varieties of panio, for
instance the full-breasted kind, clustered with small
tufts growing out of the ear, and with 3 double point ;
moreover these graeses are of various colours‚ white,
black, red and even purple. Bread of several kinds
is made even from millet, but very little from panic;
but there is no grain heavier in weight or that swells
more in baking: they get sixty pounds of bread out
of 3 peck, and a peck of porridge out of three-six-
teenths of a peek soaked in water. A millet has
been introduced into Italy from India within the last
ten years that is of 3 black colom, with a large grain
and a stalk like that of 3 reed. It grows to seven
feet in height, with very large hairs—'shey are called
the mane—and is the most prolific of all kinds of corn,
one grain producing three-sixteenths of 3 peck. It
should be sown in damp ground.

Some kinds of grain begin fo form the ear at the

third joint of the stalk and some at the fourth, but ⁰

it still remains concealed. Wheat ‘² has four articula-
tions in each stalk, emmer six and barley eight3 but
the ear does not begin to form before the above-men-
tioned number of articulations is complete; when
this has given signs of occurring‚ in four or at latest
five days they begin to blossom, and after the same
number of days or 3 few more they finish flowering;
but with barley this happens in seven days at latest.
Varro states⁶ that the grains· are fully formed in
thirty-six days and are ready for reaping after eight
months.
