and the provinces of Spain and Gaul are not men-
tioned will cause no surprise, because none of those
who have published accounts of the risings of the
constellations have made observations in respect of
those countries. Still it will not involve a difficult
calculation to ascertain them in those countries as
well, by means of the explanation of parallels which
we have set out in Book Six, which indicates the V1.21·211.

circular parallel belonging to the countries we have
specified and applying it to those that the par-

the latter as the stars' ‘ emergence' rather than
