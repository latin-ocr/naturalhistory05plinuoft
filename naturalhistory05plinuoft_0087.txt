pith would not take more. But subsequently a
more elaborate method is for as many as six grafts to
be added to reinforce their liability to die and their
number‚‘¹ a eleft being carefully made through the
middle of the trunk and being kept open by means
of a thin wedge until the grast, the end of which
has been pared into a point, goes right down into
the crack.

In this process a great many precautions have to be
observed. First ofall we must notice what kind oftree
will stand grafting of this nature, and what tree it will
take a graft from. Also the sap is variously distri-
buted, and does not lie under the bark in the same
parts with all trees: in vines and figs the middle is
drier, and generation starts from the top, shoots for
grafting being consequently taken from the top of the
tree, whereas in olives the sap is round the middle and
grafts are also taken from there, the tops being parched
up. Grafts and trunk grow together most easily
when they have the same kind of bark and when they
flower at the same time, so that they have the affinity
of the same season and a partnership ofjujces ; where-
as it is a slow business when there is incompatibility
between dry tissues and danip ones, and between hard
and soft barks. The other points to be observed are
not to make the cleft at a knot, as the inhospitable
hardness repudiates a new-comem to make it at the
shiniest place3 not to make it much more than three
inches long, nor on a slant, nor so as to be transparent.
Virgilb says that grafts must not be taken from the
top, and it is certain that the slips should be obtained
from the shoulders of the tree that look north-east,
and from trees that are good bearers and from a young
shoot, unless the tree on which they are to be grafted
