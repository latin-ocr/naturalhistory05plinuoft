Cato ‘¹ dircets conveying the trees to the fresh place in
baskets, no doubt :nost useful advice, · and moreover
he thinks it satisfactory for thc top la) er of soil to be
put at the. bottorn of the hole. Some writers say that
with pomtgranates to lay stones at the bottom of
the hole will prevent the fluit fiom bursting open on
the trce. lt is better to plant the loots in a bent
position· ‚ and it is essential for the tree itself to be so
placed as to be exactly in the middle ofthe holc. It
is said that if a fig-tree is planted stuck in a squill—
this is a kind of bulb—it bears fruit very quickly‚ and
is not liable to attacks of worm, a defect from which
all other kinds of fruit trees planted in a similar way
are exempt. Who can doubt that great care ought to
be taken with thc fibres of the roots, so that they may
appear to have been taken, not torn, out of the
ground ? On this account we omit the remaining rules
that are admitted, for instance that the earth round
the roots should be rammed tight with a light mallet,
which Cato '² thinks of primary importance in this
matter, also advising that a wound made on the trunk
should be plastered over with dung and bandaged
with leaves.

XVII. A part of this topic is the question of the
spaces between the trees. Some people have advised
planting pomeg1·anateS‚ myrtles, and laurels rather
close together, only three yards apart, apples a little
xn'der apart, pears still wider, and almonds and tigs
wider again; although this matter will best be de-
cided by taking account of the length of the branches
and the dimensions of the places concerned‚ as well
as of the shadow of each particular tree, since these
too must be considered: even large trees throw only
small shadows when their branchcs curve round into
