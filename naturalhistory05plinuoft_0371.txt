year, an important matter in the w οι ld Ι rom mid—
winter to this point the days continually grow longer.
The sun itself climbing northward for six months and
having scaled the heights of heaven, from that goal
begins to slope and to descend towards the south,
proceeding for another six months to increase the
length of the nights and to subtract from the measure-
ment of the day. From this point onward is the
time for plucking and collecting the various successive
crops and for preparing against the fierce cruelty of
winter, and to have this change marked with un-
mistakable signs was only Nature's duty3 conse-
quently she has placed such signs in the very hands
of the farmers, and has bidden the foliage to turn
round on that very day and to indicate that the
heavenly body has completed its course—and not
the leaves of the forests and of trees distant from
human habitation‚ so compelling those secking the
signs to have to go into remote valleys and moun-
tains nor yet again the foliage of the trees of
the city and those that are onlyb ov'rown by the orna-
mental ga‚rdener albeit these may be seen at a
country house as well; but Nature turns round the
foliage of the olive that confronts us at every step,
of the lime-trec which we employ for a thousand
practical purposes‚ and even of the white poplar that
is married to the vines. Nor is that yet sufficient.
‘ You have the elm‚’ she says, ‘that is enriched with
the vine3 Ι will turn the foliage of this tree also.
You strip its leaves for fodder, or prune them off:
look at these, and you have a sign of the heavens‚
