must be taken to do it when the wind is due west and
the moon on the wane and accompanied by dry
weather. Such precautions increase the fertilizing
effect of manure to a surprising degree.

the principles ofelimate and soil, we will now describe ‘'s‘ '''''
the trees that are produced by the care and skill 015 nethods

these as there are of those that grow wild, so bounti-
