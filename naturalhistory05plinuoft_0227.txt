BOOK XVIII. vn. 35—37

In old times it was thought that to observe modera- &ite ο] sarm.
tion in the size of a farm was of primary importance,
inasmuch as the view was held that it was more
satisfactory to sow less land and plough it better3
and I observe that viu-gila was of this opinion. And

which he begins the exposition of his instructions——
was too rigorous, and not to the advantage of public

be judged impossible to eredit unless its value is

closely examined-—it is that nothing pays less than

really good farming. Lucius Tarius Rufus, who, Εσοπρηιῑσ
