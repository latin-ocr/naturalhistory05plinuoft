excrescence on it protruding above the surface of the
ground3 that when an incision was made in this. a
juice resembling milk would flow out; and that there
was a stall< growing above the excrescence which they
called magydaris, that the plant had leaves of a
golden colour which serv ed as seed, being shed after
the rise of the Dogstar when a south wind was
blowing‚ and that out of these fallen leaves shoots of
laserwort used to spring, both root and stalk making
full growth in the space of a year. These authors
also stated that it was customary to dig round the
roots of the plant3 and that it djd not act as a purge
with cattle, but if they were ailing it cured them, or
else they died at once, the latter not happening in
many cases. The former view corresponds with the
Persian variety of silphium.

XVI. There is another kind of laserwort called Varieeioeos

magydaris·st which is gentlcr and lcss violent in its
effects, and has no juice 3 this grows in the neighbour-
hood of Syria, not being found in the Cyrenaica
region. Also there is a plant growing in great
abundance on Mount Parnassus that is called laser-
wort plant by some persons. All these varieties
are used for adulteration, bringing discredit on a
very salutary and useful commodity. The first test
of the genuine article is in the colour, which is
reddish‚ and white inside when the mass is broken;
and the next test is if the juice that drips out is
transparent and melts very quickly in saliva. It is
employed as an ingredient in a great many medi-
caments.
