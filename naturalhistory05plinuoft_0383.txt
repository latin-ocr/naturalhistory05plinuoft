BOOK XVIII. inx. 284—287

The life of men in early times was rude and
illiterate 3 but nevertheless it will be found that mere
observation was not less ingenious among them than
theory is now. There were three seasons which they
had to fear for their crops, and on this account they
instituted the holidays and festivals of Robigalia,
Floralia and Vinalia. Numa in the eleventh year of
his reign established the Feast of Robigalia, which is
now kept on April 25, because that is about the time
when the crops are liable to be attacked by mildew.
Varro has given this date as fixed by the sun occupying
the tenth degree of the Bull, as theory then stated3
but the true explanation is that on one or other
(according to the latitude of the various observers)
of the four days from the twenty-nintha day after
the spring equinox to April 28 the Dog sets, a con-
stellation of violent influence in itself and the setting
of which is also of necessity preceded ὁ by the setting
of the Little Dog. So the same people in 238 n.c.
in obedience to the Sibyl's oracles, instituted the
Floralia on April 23, in order that all vegetation might
shed its blossom favourably. This day is dated by
Varro at the sun's entering the 14th degree of the
Bu113 consequently if full moon falls within these
four days, the crops and all the vegetation then in
flower will inevitably suffer injmy. The First
Vinalia,c established in former days on April 23 for
tasting the wines, has no reference to the fruits of the
earth, nor yet have the festivals so far mentioned
to the vines and olives, because their sprouting
begins at the rise of the Pleiads, on May 10, as we
have explained. This is another four-day period in

brouching the casks of the new vintage.
