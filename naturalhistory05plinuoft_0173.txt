or even when a careless person ploughing underneath
them has displaced the roots or scaled the bark off the
trunk3 also a contusion may be caused by pruning
with too blunt 3 knife. All of these causes make it
more difficult for 3 vine to bear cold or hot weather,
since every harmful influcnce from outside makes
its way into the sore. But the most delicate of
all trees is the apple, and particularly any kind
that bears sweet fruit. With some trees weakness
causes barrenness but does not kill them, as is the
case with 3 pine or a palm if you lop off their top, as
they cease to bear but do not dic. Sometimes also
the fruit by itself is attacked by disease but not the
tree, if there has been 3 lack of rain or of warm
weather or wind at the times when they are needed,
or if on the contrary they have been too plentifuL
for the fruit falls off or deteriorates. The worst
among all kinds of damage is when a vine οι· olive
has been struck by heavy rain when shedding its
blossom, as the fruit is washed off at the same time.

Heavy rain also breeds catcrpillars, noxious
creatures that gnaw away the foliage of olives, and
others the flower too, as at Miletus, and leave the
half-caten tree shamefully disfigured. This pesti-
lence is brcd by damp sticky hcat3 and another one
due to the same cause occurs if too kcen a sun follows,
and burns in the damage done by the damp and so
alters its nature. There is in addition a malady
peculiar to olives and vines, called cobweb, when the
fruit gets wrapped up in a sort of webbing which
stifles it. There are also certain currents of air which
are specially blighting to olives, though they dry up
other fruit as well. As to worm, in some trees even
the fruits of themselves suffer from it—apples, pears,
