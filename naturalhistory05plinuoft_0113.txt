make trenches neither broad nor deep, but the con-
trary in warm and dry ground, so that they may
receive and retain water as much as possible. This
is the method used in cultivating old trees as well,
as in very warm localities growers heap earth over
the roots in summer and cover thern up, to prevent
the heat of the sun from parching them. In other
places they turn up the earth round them and give
access to the air, but also in winter pile up earth to
protect them from frost3 whereas growers in hot
climates open up the roots in winter and try to
obtain moisture for the thirsty trees. Everywhere
the rule is to dig a circular trench three feet in cir-
cumference round the tree, though this is not done
in meadowland because the roots, owing to their love
of sun and moisture, wander about on the surface of
the ground—And let these be our general observa-
tions in regard to planting and grafting trees for fruit.

Tbey should be set six feet apart. &Vhen three years
old they are lopped off two feet from the ground
to make them spread out wide and to enable them
to be cut back without using ladders3 for the willow
is the more productive the nearer it is to the ground.
It is advised that these trees also should be dug
round every year, in April. This is the mode of
cultivating the osier willow. The stake willow is

grown both from a rod and from a truncheon‚ in a hole
