XXXVI. The seeds of most plants are round, but Oro wtnq
those of some oblong; in a few they are foliated and ζῖξΞΞΓ {1¹⁸³
broad, for instance orage, in some narrow and grooved,ro
for instance cummin. They differ in colour as well,
dark or lighter‚ and also in woody 11 irdness The
seeds of radishes‚ mustard and turnip are contained 1n
a pod; the seed of coriander, dill, fennel and cummin
has no cover, that of blite, beet, orage and basil is
covered with a skin, while that oflettuccs is wrapped
in down. No seed is more prolific than basil; they
recommend sowing it with curses and imprecations
to make it come up more abundantly: when it is
sown the earth is rammed down. Also people sowing
cummin pray for it not to come up. It is difficult for
seeds contained· 111 3 pod to get dry,particul·1rly basil,
and consequently they are all dried artifici tlly to
make them fertile. In iny case plants grow better
when the seed is sown in heaps than when it is
scattered3 indeed it is on that principle that they
sow leek and parsley tied up in strips of rao, and also
before sou 111 parsley they make a 11016 with a dibble
into which they put dung. All pl ints grow either
from seed or from slips, or some both from seed and
from cuttings, as rue, wild marjoram, basil-for people

height of 3 palm; and some plants grow both from
seed and from a root, as onion, garlic. bulbs, and the
perennials α 1116 roots of which stay alive. But with
plants that grow from a root the root lives a long time
and throws out shoots‚ for instance bulbs, long 01110113
and squills. Others make shrubby growth and without
heads, for instance parsley and beet. When the stalk
is cut back, nearly all plants except those which have
not got a rough stem throw out fresh shoots‚ indeed
