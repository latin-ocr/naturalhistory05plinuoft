and even so there is a difficulty in rubbing off the
husks, and only half the quantity of naked grain is
produced; and afterwards a quarter the amount of
white lime is sprinkled into the grain, and when this
has stuck together with it they bolt it through a flour-
sieve. The grain that stays behind in the sieve is
called residuary and is the largest in size. That
which goes through is sifted again in a finer sieve,
and is called seconds, and likewise the name of sieve-
flour is given to that which in a similar manner stays
behind in a third extremely fine sieve that only lets
grains like sand through. There is another method
of adulteration which is everywhere used: they piel<
out from wheat the whitest and largest grain& half
boil them in pots and afterwards dry them in the sun
to half their former size and then again lightly
sprinkle them with water and erush them in a mill.
A more attractive kind of groats called trag1c17c“ is
made from zea than from other wheat, although it is
in fact merely a spurious· alica ; but it is given whiteness
by an admixture of milk boiled in it instead of chalk.

Bean meal is called lomentum, and it is used in bread
made for sale to increase the weight‚ as is meal made
from all the leguminous plants, and nowadays even
cattle fodder. Beans are used in a variety of ways for
all kinds of beasts and especially for man. With most
nations it is also mixed with corn, and most of all with
panio, for this purpose it is either used whole or
broken up rather fine. Mor-eover in ancient ritual
