XXXIX. Now that we have set out the diseases Ret emcdiessor
of trees it is suitable also to state the remedies for (ὴζ ⁰⁸⁹³ ⁰s
them. Some of these are common to all trees and W {tikesos
some peculiar to some of them. Remedies common ’ν κε’
to all are loosening the soil, banking it up, admitting
air to the roots or covering them up, making a
channel to give them water or to drain it away,
dung refreshing them with its juice, pruning to
relieve them of weight, also letting out the sap like
a surgical blood-letting‚ scraping a ring of bark,
stretching out the vine-sprays and chet-king the shoots,
trimming off and as it were polishing up the buds if
they have been shrivelled and roughened by eold
weather. Some trees like these treatments more
and others less, for example the eypress scorns both
water and dung and hates being dug round and
pruned and all kinds of nursing, in fact irrigation
kills it, whereas it is exceptionally nourishing for
vines and pomegranates. In the case of the fig
irrigation nourishes the tree itself but makes the
fruit decay. Almond- trees lose their blossom if the

ground round them is made clean by beinsr dug
ov.er Also trees that have been gl πΐῒεᾶ must not
be dug round before they are strong and begin
to bear fruit. Most trees however w mt to have
their burdensome and superfluous growth pruned

trees are eut down entirely and spring up again
from some sucker, but they will not ill do this⁰b11t
