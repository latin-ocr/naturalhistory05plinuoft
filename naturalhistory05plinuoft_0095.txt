tiles blocked up at each end with earth3 but it is
thought that vine-cuttings are best stored in dry
ditches, under a covering of straw, with earth then
piled over them so as to let their tops protrude.
XXV. Cat0⁰ has three ways of grafting a vine: crastino

he advises cutting the stock short and splitting it ''ne‘’
through the pith, and then inserting into it the
shoots aster sharpening them at the end in the manner
stated above, and making the cambium ὁ of the two §106-
meet ; the second method is, in case the vines are con-
tiguous with one another, to pare down on a slant
the side of each that faces the other and to tie them
together with the cambiums joined 3 and the third is to
bore a slanting hole in the vine down to the pith
and insert slips a couple of feet long, and to tie the
graft in that position and cover it up with a plaster of
pounded earth, with the shoots upright. Our genera-
tion has improved on this meth0d‚ so as to employ a
Gallie auger which makes a hole in the tree without
scorching it, because all scorching weakens it, and
to select a slip that is beginning to bud, and not
to let it protrude from the stock by more than two
eyeS‚ . . . of an elm . . . tied on with a withe . . .
put two round . . . on two sides with a knife,⁶ so that
the slime which is the greatest enemy of vines may
chiefly exude through them, and then when the whips
have made two feet of growth‚ to cut the tie of the
graft, allowing its growth to make thickness. They
have fixed the time for grafting vines from the
autumn equinox till the beginning of budding.
Cultivated plants are grafted on roots of wild
ones, which are of a closer texture, whereas if slips
of cultivated plants are grafted on the trunks of
wild ones they degeneratc to the wild variety.
