the same day for Egypt3 likewise on J anuary 8 the
Dolphin before mentioned sets in the evening and
there are some days of continuous wintry wcather
for Italy ; and so also when the sun is scen to pass into
Aquarius, which happens about J anuary 17. On
January 25 the star in the breast of the Lion called
according to Tubero the Royal Star sets in the morning
and the Lyre sets in the evening of February 4. In
the concluding days of this period, whenevcr the
weather conditions allow, the ground should bc turned
up with a double mattock for planting roses and vines
—seventy hands are enough for an acre—and ditches
should be cleaned or new ones made, and the time
before daybreak should be used for sharpening iron
tools‚ fitting handles, repairing broken vats, doing up
the shelters used for sheep and cleaning the sheeps’
fleeces by seraping them.

LXV. Between the period of west wind and the
spring equinox, February 16 for Caesar marks three

days of changeable weather, as also does February w r

22 by the appearance of the swallow and on thc next
day the rising of Arcturus in the evcning‚ and the
same on March 5—Caesar noticed that this bad
weather took place at the rising of the Crab, but the
majority of the authorities put it at the setting of
the Vintager—-on March 8 at the rising of the
northern part of the Fish‚ and on the next day
at the rising of Orion; in Attica it is noticed that
the constellation Kite appears. Caesar also noted
March 15-the day that was fatal to him—as
marked by the Setting of the Scorpion, but stated
that on March 18 the Kite becomes visible in
Italy and on March 21 the Horse sets in the
morning.
