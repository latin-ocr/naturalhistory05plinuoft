making a longer stall< simultaneously tops off into
grooved protuberances. It can also be grown from
seed. No subject included by Cato is treated more
carcfully, and it is the last topic of his book, showing
that it was a novelty just creeping in. His advice is
to dig ovcr a place with a damp or heavy soil and sow
the seeds six inches apart each way, so as to avoid
treading on them; and moreover to put two or
three seeds in each hole, made with a dibble along a
line—obviously at that time asparagus was only
grown from seed. He recommends doing this after
the. vernal equinox, using plenty of dung, fre-
quently cleaning with the hoe, taking care not to
pull up the asparagus with the weeds, in the first
year protecting the plants against winter with straw,
uncovering them in spring and hoeing and stubbing
the ground3 and setting sire to the plants in the third
spring. The earlier asparagus is burnt off, the better
it thrives, and consequently it is specially suitable
for growing in reed-beds‚ which burn speedily. He
also advises not hocing the beds before the asparagus
springs up, for fear of disturbing the roots in the pro-
cess ofhoeing; next plucking off the asparagus heads
close to the root, because if they are broken off, the
plant runs to stall< and dics off3 going on plucking
thern till they run to seed (which begins to mature
towards spring-time) and burning them off, and when
the asparagus plants have appeared, hocing thcm ovcr
again and manuring them. Nine years later, he says,
when the plants are now old, they must be separated
and the ground worked over and manurcd‚ and then
they must be replanted with the tufts spaccd out a
foot apart. Moreover hc expressly specifics using
