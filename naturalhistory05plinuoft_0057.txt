BOOK XVII. x. 59-x1. 62

there are some trees that are not grown in any
other way, for instance chestnuts and walnuts, with
the exception, that is, of those intended for felling;
but also some grown in other ways are grown
from seed as well, though a different kind of seed—-
for instance vines and apples and pears-as with
these a pip serves as a seed, and not the actual fruit,
as in the case of the trees mentioned above. Also
medlars can be grown from seed. All of these trees
are slow in coming on, and liable to degenerate so
as to have to be restored by grafting3 and some-
times this happens even with chestnuts.

XI. Some trees on the other hand have the pro·
perty of not degenerating at all in whatever way they
are propagated‚ for instance cypresses, the palm and
laurels—for the laurel also can be propagated in a
variety of ways. We have stated the various kinds xv. 12711.
oflaurel. Os these the Augusta, the berry laurel and
the laurustinus are propagated in a similar manner:
their berries are picked in January, after they have
been dried by a spell of north-east wind, and are
spread out separately, so as not to ferment by lying
in a heap3 afterwards some peoplc treat them with
dung in preparation for sowing and soak them with
urine, but others put them in running water in a wicker
basket, and stamp on them till the skin is washed
away, which otherwise is attacked by stagnant
moisture and does not allow them to bear. They
are planted in a freshly dug trench a hand‘s breadth
deep, about twenty in a cluster3 this is done in March.
These laurels can also be propagated by layering,
but the laurel worn in triumphal processions can only
be grown from a cutting. Myrtles of all varieties
are grown from berries in Campania, but at Rome
