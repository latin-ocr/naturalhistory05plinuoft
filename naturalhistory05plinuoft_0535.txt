XLIV. A cursory description can suffice for the rest omer planes
of the plants. The best time for sowing basil is said s⁰⁷ ⁸⁰1⁰ss
to be at the Feast of Pales? and some say in autumn
also, advising that when it is sown for winter the seed
should be moistened with vinegar. Also rocket and
cress can be grown very easily either in summer
or in winter. Rocket particularly thinks nothing of
cold. Its properties are quite different from those of
lettuce, and it acts as an aphrodisiac3 consequently
it is usually blended with lettuce in a salad, so that
the excessive chilliness of the lettuce may be tem-
pered and counter-balanced by being mingled with
an equal amount of heat. Cress has got its Latin
nameb from the pain that it gives 'co the nostrils,
and owing to this the sense of vigorousness has
attached itself to that word in the current ex-
pression,⁶ as denoting a stimulant. It is said to
grow to a remarkably large size in Arabia.

XLV. Rue also is sown when the west wind blows Rue.
in spring, and just after the autumn equinox. It
hates cold weather, damp and dung, and likes sunny,
dry places and a soil containing as much brick-clay
as possible3 it requires to be manured with ashes,
which are also mixed with the seed to banish cater-
pillars. Rue was held in special importance in old
times: Ι find that honied wine flavoured with rue
was given to the public by Cornelius, Quintus
Flamininus's colleague in the consulship, after the 32:31³.st
election had been concluded. Rue is so friendly
with the fig that it grows better under this tree
than anywhere else. It can also be grown from a
slip, preferably inserted into 3 hole made in a bean,
which holds the slip firmly and nourishes it with its
juice. It also reproduces itself by layering‚ since if
