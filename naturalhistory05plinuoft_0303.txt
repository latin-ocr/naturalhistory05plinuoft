less liable to disease. Virgil recommends steeping ¹⁹³·
bean in native soda and dregs from oil-presses‚ and
also guarantees this as a method ofincreasing its size.
Others however hold the view that it grows specially
well if it is kneaded in a mixture of urine and water
three days before sowing3 and at all events that if
the crop is hoed three times it will yield a peck of
crushed beans from a peck of whole beans3 and that
the other kinds of seeds are not liable to maggots if
mixed with crushed cypress leaves, and also if sown
just before a new moon. As ‘a cure for diseases
of millet many recommend carrying a toad round
the field at night before it is hoed and then burying
it in the middle of the field, with a pot for a
coffin ; it is then prevented from being damaged by a
sparrow or by worms3 but it must be dug up before
the field is sown, otherwise the land turns sour.
They also say that seed is made more fertile if it is
touched by the forequarters of a mole. Democritus
advises soaking all seeds before they are sown in the
juice of the plant that grows on roos-tiles, called in
Greek aeizoon ‘² and by other people ‘ under-the-
eaves '‚ and in our language ‘squat' or ⁴ little
finger ⁸. But if damage is being done by blight and
by worms adhering to the roots, a common remedy
is to sprinkle the plant with pure olive oil lees, not
salted‚ and then to hoe, and if the crop is beginning
to shoot out into knots to weed it, so that weeds may
not get the upper hand. Ι know for a fact that
ssights of starlings or sparrows, the plague of common
and Italian millets, can be driven away from them by
burying a plant, the name of which is unknown to me,
