XX. No grain is greedier than wheat or draws
more nourishment out of the soil. Common wheat I
may properly designate the choicest variety, whether
in whiteness or goodness or weight. It is suitable
for moist districts like those in Italy and Gallia
Comata, but across the Alps it only keeps its char-
acter in the territory of Savoy and Remis, while in
the other parts of that country it changes in two
years into ordinary wheat. The cure for this is to
select its heaviest grains for sowing. Common wheat
flour makes bread of the highest quality and the
most famous pastry. The top place in Italy is taken
by a mixture of Campanian common wheat flour with
that grown at Pisa, the former being reddish but the
chalk-like Pisa variety whiter and heavier. A fair
yield from the Campanian grain called ‘ bolted ' is to
give four sixteenths of fine flour to the peck, or from
what is called common grain, not bolted, five six-
teenths, as well as half a peck of fine flour and four
sixteenths of the coarse meal called ⁴ seconds ⁹, and
the same amount of bran3 whereas Pisa wheat
should give four sixteenths of prime flour, while of
the other kinds the yield is the same. The wheats
of Chiusi and Arezzo give an additional sixteenth of
prime flour, but in the remaining qualities they are
on a level. If however it is wished to make special
flour, the return is sixteen pounds of bread and three
pecks of seconds and half a peck of bran. This
depends on different methods of milling;· for grain
ground when dry gives more flour, but if sprinkled
with salt water it makes a whiter meal, but keeps
more back in the bran. The name for flour,farina‚
is obviously derived from far, emmer. A peck
of flour made of Gallie common wheat gives 20
