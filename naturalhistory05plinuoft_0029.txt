in the same class oftrees, as for example among pears.
winter v·a1ieties require rain on one day and early
pears on mother, although they all alike need a period
of wintry weather before budding. The same cause
that makes a north- west wmd more beneficial than
a south-w est wind also renders inland regions superior
to places on the coast—the reason being that they are
usually eooler—and mountain districts superior to
plains, and rain in the night preferable to rain by day,
vegetation getting more enjoyment from the water
when the sun does not immediately make it evaporato.

Connected with this subject is also the theory of
the situation for vineyards and trees a—what aspect
they should face. Virgil condemned their being
planted looking west, but some have preferred that
aspect to an easterly position, while most authori—
ties, I notice, approve the south3 and I do not
think that any hard and fast rule can be laid down
on this point—skilled attention must be paid to the
nature of the soil, the character of the locality and
the features of the particular climate. In Africa
for vineyards to face south is bad for the vine and
also unhealthy for the gr0we1·‚ because the country
itself lies under the southern quarter of the sky,
and consequently he who there chooses a westerly
or northern aspect for planting will achieve the
best blending of soil with climate. When Virgil
condemns a western aspect, there seems no dou’bt
that he condemns a northern aspect also, although in
Italy below the Alps it has generally been experi-
enced that no vineyards bear better than those so
situated. The wind also forms a great consideration.
In the province of Narbonne and in Liguria and part of
Tuscany it is thought to be a mistake to plant vines
