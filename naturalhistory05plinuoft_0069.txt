planted, mounds 3 ft. high from the ground level
should be heaped round them—the name for these

must be settled according to the nature of the place:
in level country it is suiiable to plant the young trees
wider apart. It is also proper to plant out poplars and
ashes earlier, because they bud more quickly-—that is,

trees also growing from cuttings. In spacing out trees
and plantations and planning vineyards the diagonal

passage of air, but also agreeable in appearance, as in

trees strctches out in a straight line. In the case of
poplars the same method of growing them from seed
is used as with 611113, and also the same method of
transplanting them from nurseries or forests.

in advance-—if possible, long enough before to allow
the holes to get covered over with thick turf. Mago
advises a year in advance, so as to let the 110163 absorb
the sunshine and rain, or, if circumstances do not
allow of this, he recommends making fires in the
middle of the holes two months before, and only
planting the seedlings in the holes 30 prepared just
after rain has fallen. He says that in a clay soil or a
hard soil the pits should measure 4 ft. 6 in. each way,
or 4 inches more on sloping sites, and he prescribes
