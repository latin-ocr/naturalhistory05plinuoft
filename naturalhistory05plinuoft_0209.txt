Circus—the third⁰ of these divinities it is irreverent
even to mention by name indoors--and people used
not even to taste the produce of a new harvest or
vintage before the priests had offered a libation of
the first-fruits.

III. An area of land that one yoke of oxen could Early cns-

eoms reanum}

plough in a day used to be called an aerest and a i„ nommzcza-

distance which oxen could be driven with a plough fssssgfffflry

in a single spell of reasonable length was called a
furlong ⁰3 this was 40 yardS‚ and doubled longways
this made an acre. The most lavish gifts bestowed
on generals and valorous citizens were the largest
area of land that a person could plough round in
one day, and also a contribution from the whole
people of one or two quarterns of emmer wlieat a
head. Moreover the earliest surnames‘l were derived
from agriculture: the name ‘ Pilumnus ’ belonged to
the inventor of the ‘ pestle ’ for corn-mills, ‘ Piso '
came from ‘ pounding ’ corn, and again families were
named Fabius or Lentulus or Cicero? according as
someone was the best grower of some particular crop.
One of the ,Iunius family received the name of
Bubulcus because he was very good at managing oxon.
Moreover among religious rites none was invested
with more sanctity than that of Communion in VVheat,
and newly married brides used to carry in their hands
an offering of wheat. Bad husbandry was judged an
offence within the jurisdiction of the censors‘‚ and, as
Catos tells us, to praise a man by saying he was a
good farmer and a good husbandman was thought to

⁸ Faba ‘bean ’, lens ‘lentil ⁷, cicer ‘chiek-pea'. The per-
sonal names if actually derived from these vegetables were
more probably nick-namcs than trade-names.
