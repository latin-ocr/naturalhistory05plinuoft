this plan is to burn up the seed of weeds. The size
of the crops and scarcity of labour cause various
procedures to be adopted.

storing corn. Some people recommend building mm·
elaborate granaries with brick walls a yard thick,
and moreover filling thern from above and not
letting them admit draughts of air or have any
windows; others say they should only have windows
fac-ing north-east or north, and that they should be
built without lime, as lime is very injurious to corn:
the recommendations made with rcgard to the dregs
of olive—oil have been pointed out above. In other XV. 33.
places, on the contrary, they build their granaries of
wood and supported on pillars, preferring to let the
air blow through them from all sides, and even from
below, Others think the grain shrinks in bulk if laid
on a floor entirer off the ground, and that if it lies
under 3 tile roof it gets hot. Many moreover for-
bid turning over the grain to air it, as the weevil
does not penetrate more than four inches down, and
beyond that the grain is in no danger. Columella 11.20,r›.
also advises 3 west wind when corn is hmwested, at
which I for my part am surprised‚ as generally it is
a very dry wind. Some people tell us to hang up a
toad by one of its longer legs at the threshold of the
barn before carrying the corn into it. To us storing
the corn at the proper time will seem most im-
