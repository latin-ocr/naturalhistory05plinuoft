thought proper to allow an old main branch to shoot
out to a great length and as far as a fourth prop,
like the old growths called by some ‘ snake-branchos '
and by others ‘ cables '‚ so as to make what are named
‘ male growths ’. &Vhen a vine has become hard,
it is very bad to bring it across on a trellis. XVhen
a vine is four years old the main branches them-
selves also are twisted over, and each throws out one
growth of wood, first one and then the next ones,
and the earlier shoots are pruned away. It is always
better to leave a keeper-shoot, but this should be
one next the vine, and not longer than the length
that was stated; and if the main branehes shoot too §181-
luxuriantly, to twist them back, so that the vine
may produce only four growths of wood, or even
only two if it is trained on a single cross-bar.

If the vine is to be trained by itself without a prop, anesorown
at the beginning it will want some sort of support ssssssour‘„
until it learns to stand and to rise up straight,
while in all other respects it will need the same treat-
ment from the start, except that it will need to have
the pruned stumps distributed by pruning in a regular
cluster all round, so that the fruit may not overload
one side of the tree. Incidentally, the fruit weighing
down the bough will prevent it from shooting right
up high. With this vine a height of above a yard
begins to bend over, but all the others start bending
at five feet, only the height must not be allowed to
exceed the average height of a man. Growers also
put low cages round the vines that spread out on
the ground, to restrict their spread, with trenches
made round them, so that the straggling branches
may not meet each other and fight3 and the greater
part of the world lets its vintage grapes lie on the
