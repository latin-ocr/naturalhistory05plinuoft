when the moon is silent.‘³ This is also the time for
getting ready a store of leaves 3 ὁ to collect four leaf-
baskets full is a fair day’s work for one woodman.
If they are stored when the moon is on the wane
they do not decay3 but they ought not to be dry
when collected.

time3 consequently we must also specify the times
for this by their signs and indications. The rules ⁶ are
as follows : ‘ Do not pick a bunch of grapes when they
are warn1’——that is during unbroken dry weather,
with no rain in between: ‘Do not pick a bunch of
grapes if wet with dew '‚ that is if there has been dew
in the night, and not before it has been dispelled by
the sun. ‘ Begin the vintage when the grape—shoot
begins to droop down to the stem, or when after a
grape has been removed from a cluster it has been
clearly noticed that the gap does not fill up and that
the grapes are no longer getting bigger.’ It is a
very great advantage for the vintage to coincide
with a crescent moon. One pressing‘i ought to fill
twenty wine-skinse: that is a fair basis. A single
wine press is enough for twenty wine-skins and
vats to serve twenty acres of vineyard. Some press
the grapes with a single press-beam‚ but it pays
better to use a pair, however large the single beams
may be. It is length that matters in the case
of the beams, not ‘thickness3s but those of ample
width press better. In old days people used to drag
down the press-beams with ropes and leather straps.
