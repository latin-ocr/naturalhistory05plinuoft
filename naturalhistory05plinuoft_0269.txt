boiled with prime flour of emmer and then mixed with
the flour, this process being thought to produce the
best bread. The Greeks t:z'hue decided that two-
thirds of an ounce of leav en i< enough for every two
half· -pecks of flour. Men-(ov er though these kinds of
leaven can only be made in the vint ige season, it is
possible at any time one chooses to make leaven
from water and barley‚ making two-pound cakes and
baking them in ashes and charcoal on a hot hearth
or an earthenware dish till they turn brown, and
afterwards keeping them shut up in vessels till they
go sour3 then soaked in water they produce leaven.
But when barley bread used to be made, the actual
barley was leavened m‘th flour of bitter vetch or
chickling3 the proper amount was two pounds of
leaven to every two and a half pecks of barley. At
the present time leaven is made out of the flour
itself, which is kneaded before salt is added to it
and is then boiled down into a kind of porridge and
left till it begins to go sour. Generally however they
do not heat it up at all, but only use the dough kept
over from the day before3 manifestly it is natural
for sourness to make the dough ferment, and likewise
that people who live on fermented bread have weaker
bodies, inasmuch as in old days outstanding whole-
someness was ascribed to wheat the heavier it. was.
