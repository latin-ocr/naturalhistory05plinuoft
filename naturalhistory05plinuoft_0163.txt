La Riccia‚ which are pruned every other year, not,
because that is bcneficial for a vinc but because
owing to the low price at which the wine sells the
expenses might cxceed the return. In the Casigliano
district they follow an intcrmediate compromise,
and by the plan of pruning away only the decayed
parts of the vinc and those beginning to wither, and
leaving the rest to bear grapes relieved of superfluous
weight, the scantiness of the injury inflicted serves
instead of all nutriment; but except in a rich soil
this method of cultivation degenerates into a wild
xine.

'lhe trees for training vines on require the giound ir eazotmevt ο(
to be ploughed as deep as possible, although the {mspr [1
system of growing corn there does not need this. It
is not customary for them to be trimmed of leaves, and
this economizes labour. They arc pruned together
with the vine, light being let through the dcnsity of
branches that are superfluous and consume nutriment.

We have given the rule against leaving lopped ends s· 8⁴-
facing north or south, and it is better not to let them
face west either, as wounds facing in those directions
too suffer for a long time and heal with difficulty,
because of undergoing excessive cold or heat: there
is not the same freedom as in the case of thc vine,
since trees have fixed aspects, but it is casicr to hide
away the wounds of a vine and twist thern in any
direction you like. In pruning trees cup-like hollows
should be made with a mouth sloping downwards, to
prevent water from lodging in them
