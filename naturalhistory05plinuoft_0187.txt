XL. Irrigation is good for trees in the heat of lrriqacf‹.210s
summer but bad for them in winter3 in the autumn trees.
its effect varies and depends on the nature of the
soil, inasmuch as in the Spanish provinces the vin-
tager picks the grapes when the ground is under
water, whereas in the greater part of the world it
pays to drain off the rain water even in autumn.
Irrigation is most beneficial about the rising of the
Dogstar, and even then not too much of it, because
it hurts the roots when they are soaked to the
point of intoxication. The age of the tree also
controls the due amount; young saplings are not
so thirsty. But those that require most watering
are those that have been used to it, whereas those
which have sprung up in dry places only need a
bare minimum of moisture.

XLI. The harsher vines need to be watered, at all

events in the Fabii district of the territory of Sulmo
in Italy, where they irrigate even the plough-land3
and it is a remarkable fact thatin that part of the coun-
try water kills herbaceous plants but nourishes corn,
and irrigation takes the place of a hoe for weeding.
In the same district they irrigate the land round the
vines at midwinter to prevent their suffering from
cold, the more so if snow is lying or there is a frost3
this process is there called ‘ warming ' the vines,
owing to the remarkable influence of the sun on the
river‚‘² which in summer is almost unbearably cold.
