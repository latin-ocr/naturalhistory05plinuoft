BOOK XIX. L111. 167—L1v. 171

LIII. There are some plants that are sown in com· Poppu.
pany with others, for instance the poppy, which is sown
with cabbage and purslain, and rocket is sown with
lettuce. There are three kinds of cultivated poppy:
the white, the seed of which in old days used to be
roasted and served with honey at second course3 it is
also sprinkled on the top crust of country lom-es, an
egg being poured on to make it stick‚ while celery
and git are used to give the bottom crust a festival
flavour. The second kind of poppy is the black
poppy, from which a milky juice is obtained by
making an incision in the stalk. The third kind i
called by the Greeks rhoeas ⁰ and in our country wild
poppy; it does indeed grow uncultivated, but chiefly
in fields sown with barley; it resembles rocket, and
grows eighteen inches high, with a red flower which
falls very quickly, and which is the origin of its Greek
name. We shall speak of the remaining kinds of XX·1⁹8·
sels-sown poppy under the head of drugs. That the
poppy has always been in favour at Rome is indicated
by the story of Tarquinius the Proud, who knocked
off the heads of the tallest poppies in his garden and
by means of this unspoken rebus conveyed to the
envoys sent to him by his son that sanguinary answer
of his.

LIV. Again there is another group of plants which itu-uara
are sown at the autumn equinox--coriander‚ dill, Zssfflss'ff
orage,maIIOW‚sorrel‚chervil,the Greek name for which ⁸⁰¹0'1 ''07⁶³-
is lad’s love, and mustard, which with its pungent taste
and fiery effect is extremely beneficial for the health.

It grows entirely wild, though it is improved by being
transplanted: but on thc other hand when it has
once been sown it is scarcely possible to get the place
free of it, as the seed when it falls germinates at once.
