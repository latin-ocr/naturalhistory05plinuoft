radish‚ and an angular leaf with a rough surface and
an aeid juice which if extracted at harvest time and
mixed m'th a woman’s milk makes an eye-wash and
a cure for dim sight. They are believed to grow
sweeter and bigger in cold weather3 warni weather
makes them run to leaves. The prizc goes to turnip
grown in the Noreia district-it is priced at a sesterce
per pound, and at two sesterces in a time of scarcity—
and the next to those grown on Monte Compatri3
XXXV. but the prize for navews goes to those grown
at San Vettorino. Navews have almost the same
nature as turnips: they are equally fond of cold
places. They are sown even before the first of March,
4 sixteenths of a peck in an acre. The more careful
growers recommend ploughing five times before
sowing navew and four times for turnip, and manuring
the ground in both cases; and they say that turnip
grows a finer crop if the seed is ploughed in with
some chaff. They advise that the sower should strip
for the work, and should offer a prayer in the words,
⁴ I sow for myself and my neighbours.' For both
these kinds sowing is properly done between the
holidays ‘² of two deities, Neptune and Vulcan‚ and
as a result of careful observation it is said that these
seeds give a wonderfully fine crop if they are sown
on a da)v that is as many days aster the beginning of
the period specified as the moon was old when the
first snow fell in the preceding winter. In warm and
damp localities turnip and navew are also sown in
