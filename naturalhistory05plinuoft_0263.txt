but on the other hand in Egypt it is easy to
thresh and gives a good yield. Emnier has no beard,
nor has common wheat, excepting the kind called
Laconian. With these are also to be classcd bromos
and trag05‚“ entirely foreign grains, resembling rice
imported from the east. Tiphe itself also belongs to
the same class—the grain from which a rice is pro-
duced in our part of the world. With the Greeks there
is also zea, and according to their account that grain
and tiphe degenerate and go back to wheat, if they
are sown after being ground, though not at once, but
two years latent>

XXI. Nothing is more prolific than wheat—Nature
having given it this attribute because it used to be
her principal means of nourishing man—inasrnuch as
3 peck of wheat, given suitable soil like that of the
Byzacium plain in Africa, produces a yield of 150
pecks. The deputy governor of that region sent to
his late Majesty Augustus—almost incredible⁰ as it
seems—a parcel of very nearly 400 shoots obtained
from a single grain as seed, and there are still in exist-
ence despatches relating to the matter. He likewise
sent to Nero also 360 stalks obtained from one grain.
At all events the plains of Lentini and other districts
in Sicily, and the whole of Andalusia, and particularly
Egypt reproduce at the rate of a hundredfold. The
most prolific kinds of wheat are branched wheat ‘l and
what they call hundred—grain wheat. Also a single
beanstalk has before now been found laden with a
hundred beans.
