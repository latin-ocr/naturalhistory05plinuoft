stars begin or cease to be visible at the rising or
Setting of the sun, these being designate-d their
morning or evening risings and settings according as
each of them occurs at dawn or at dusk. They re-

LIX. The divisions of the seasons are fixed by the
fourfold distribution of the year corresponding with
the increases and decreases of daylight. From mid-
winter onward this increases in length, and in 90 days
3 hours at the spring equinox the day becomes equal
to the night. From then to the summer solstice, a
period of 94 days 12 hours, the day is longer than
the night . . . until the autumn equinox, and then
the night having become equal to 1110 day goes on
increasing from that point until midwinter, a period
of 88 days 3 hours (in the present passage the term
⁸ hours ' in each addition and subtraction denotes equi-
noctial hours and not the hours ofany day in particular ὁ)
and all these changes occur at the eighth degree of the
signs of the zodiac, midwinter at the eighth degree of
Capricorn, about December 26, the equinox at the
eighth of the Ram, the summer solstice at the eighth
of the Crab and the other equinox at the eighth of
the Scales——which days themselves als-o usually give
some indications of changes of weather. Again these

and night together only at the equinoxes, and at other periods
was longer by day aud shorter by night, or vice versa.
