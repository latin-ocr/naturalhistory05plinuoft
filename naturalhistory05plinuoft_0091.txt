waxing‚ and that both hands must be used in pressing
it home3 and apart from that, to use both hands at
once in this job requires less effert, as it involves
combining their forces. Grafts pressed in too forcibly
are slower in bearing but last more stoutly‚ while the
contrary procedure has the opposite results. The
crack must not gape too wide and afford 3 10056 hold,
nor yet not wide enough, so as to squeeze the graft out
or to kill it by pressure3 special care must be taken
to avoid the latter in the trunk of a tree that takes the
graft with an excessively powerful hold. In order that
a cleft may be left in the middle, some people make
a line of cleavage in the trunk with a pruning-hook
and bandage the actual edge of the incision with a
withe, and afterwards force it apart with a wedge, the
bandage keeping it from gaping open too freely.
Some slips are grafted on plants in 3 seed-plot
and then are transplanted on the same day. If 3
rather thick stock is used for grafting, it is better to
insert it between the bark and the wood, after using
a wedge, preferably of bone, to loosen the bark, so as
not to break it. Cherry-trees have their inner rind re-
moved before the incision is made. They are the only
trees that are grafted even after midwinter. After
the bark has been removed they have a layer of a sort
of down, and if this gets a hold on the graft it makes it
decay. The most effective way of tightening the
bandage is by driving 3 wedge into it ; it suits best to
insert it as close to the ground as the formation of the
tree and the knots allows. Grafts ought not to
project to a length of more than six inches.

Cato ‘¹ recommends making a mixture of pounded
white clay or chalk and cowdung and so working it
to a sticky consistency‚ and putting this into the fissure
