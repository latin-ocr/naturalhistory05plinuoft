BOOK XVIII. van. 261—263

former days, when only Cretan and other imported
whetstones were known, and these would only liven
up the blade of a scythe with the help of olive oil;

and consequently a man mowing hay used to walk
along with a horn to hold the oil tied to his leg. Italy
gave us whetstones used with water, which keep the
iron in order instead of a file, though the water very
soon makes them go green with rust. Of scythes
themselves there are two kinds: the Italian kind is
shorter, and handy to use even among b1·‹1mble‚s

whereas the scythe used on the large farms of the
Gallie provinces are bigger, in fact they economize
labour by cutting through the stalks of the grass in
the middle and missing the shorter ones. An Italian
mower holds the sickle with only his right hand. It
is a fair day’s work for one labourer to cut an acre of
grass, or to bind 200⁶ sheaves weighing four pounds
each. After the grass is cut it must be turned
towards the sun, and it must not be piled in shocks
till it is dry; unless this rule is earefully kept, the
shocks are certain to give off a sort of vapour in the
morning and then to be set alight by the sun and to
burn up. A hayfield should be irrigated again after
it has been mown, so as to provide 3 crop of
autumn hay called the aftermath. At Terni in
Umbria even hayfields not irrigated are mown four
times a year, but those with irrigation are in most
places mown three times, and afterwards as much
profit is made out of the pasture as from the hay.
Accordingly keeping herds and breeding draft-
animal< will supply each farmer with his own policy,
3 most lucrative trade being breeding horses for
chariot-racing.
