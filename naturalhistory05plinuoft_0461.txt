We find it stated in the most reliable authors of Provenance
(ireece that this plant first sprang up in the vicinity sslfffisssfszf's
of the Gardens of the Hesperids and the Greater
Syrtis after the ground had been suddenly soaked
by a shower of rain the colour of pitch, seven years
before the foundation of the town of Cyrenae, which
was in the year of our city 1433 that the effect of this 611 Rc.
rainfall extended over 500 miles of Africa3 and that
the laserwort plant grew widely in that country
as an obstinate weed, and if cultivated, escaped into

be obtained in two ways, from the root and from the

proof of its being ripe was its colour and dryness‚ the
damp juice having completely disappeared. Other
accounts say that the plant had a root more than 18
