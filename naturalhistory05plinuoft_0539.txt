of all the seasonings which gratify ⁰ a fastidious teste,
cummin is the most agrecable. It grows on the
surfacc. of the ground, hardly adhering to the soil and
stretching upward, and it should be sown in the middle
of spring, in crumbly and specially warm soils.
Another kind of cummin is the wild variety called
country cummin, or by other people Thebaieb cummin.
For pounding up in water and using as a draught in
cases of stomach-ache the most highly csteemed kind
in our continent is that grown at Carpetania, though
elsewhere the prize is awarded to Ethiopian and
African cummim however some prefer the Egyptian
to the African.

XLVIII. A herb ofexceptionally remarkable nature
is black-herb‚⁶ the Greek name for which is horse-
parsley, and which others call zmyrnium. It is
reproduced from the gum that trickles from its own
stalk, but it ean also be grown from a root. The
people who collect its juice say that it tastes like
myrrh‚ and Theophrastus ἀ states that it sprang first
from sown myrrh seed. Old writers had recom-
mended sowing horse-parsley in uncultivated stony
ground near a garden wall; but at the present day
it is sown in land that has been dug over and also
after a west wind has followed the autumn equinox.
The reason for the old plan was that the caper also
is sown principally in dry places, after a plot llas
been hollowed out for deep digging and stone banks
have been built all round it: otherwise it strays all
over the fields and takes the fertility out of the soil.
It blossoms in summer and continues green till the
setting of the Pleiads; it is most at home in sandy
soil. The bad qualities of the caper that grows over
seas we have spoken of among the exotic shrubs.
