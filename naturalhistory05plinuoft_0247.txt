surprising to me that the later Greeks have made no
mention of this corn.

At the present the lightest. in weight mgnum] the
kinds of wheat imported to Rome is the wheat o
Gaul, and that brought from the Cffheffi ⁴=,‹›nese as
they do not exceed twenty pounds a pcck, if one
weighs the grain by itself. Sardinian grain adds
half a pound to this figure, and Alexandrini a third
of a pound more—this is also the neight of Sicilian
wheat—xs h1le that of Southern Spain scores a xxhole
pound more and that of Africa a pound and three-
quarters. In Italy north of the Po the peck of emmer
to my knowledge weighs 25 pounds, and in the
Chiusi neighbourhood even 26 pounds. It is a fixed
law of nature that in any kind of commissariat
bread⁰ a third part is added in the making to the
weight of the grain, just as that the best whcat is
that which absorbs three quarts of water into the
peck of grain kneaded. Some kinds of grain used
by themselves give their full weight, for instance a
peck of Balearic wheat produces 35 pounds of bread,
but some only do so when blended—for example,
Cyprian wheat and Alexandrian, which used by thern-
selves do not go beyond 20 pounds a peck. Cyprus
wheat is of a dusky colour and makes black bread,
and consequently the white Alexandrian is mixed
with it, and that gives 25 pounds of bread to the peck.
The wheat of the Thebaid in Egypt makes a pound
more. To knead the flour with sea water, which they
frequently do in seaside places for the sake of econo-
mizing salt, is extremely inexpedient‚ as there is
nothing else that rcndcrs the body more liable to
disease. When the corn of Gaul and Spain of the
