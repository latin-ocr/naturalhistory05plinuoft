XXXII. In Egypt people swear by garlic and onions Vqr-ierim os
as deities in taking an oath. Among the Greeks the ''¹¹¹⁰''-
varieties of onion are the Sardiniam, Samothraciam,
Alsidenian‚ setanian, the split onion‚ and the
Ascalon onion α, named from a town in Judaea. In all
these the body consists entirely of coats of greasy
cartilage; also they all have a smell which makes
one’s eyes water, especially the Cyprus onions‚ but
least of all those of Cnidos. The smallest of all except
the Tuscany onion is the setanian, though it has a
sweet taste3 but the split onion and the Ascalon
onion need flavouring. The split onion is left with
its leaves on in winter, these being pulled off in
spring, and others grow in their place at the same
divisions, from which these onions get their name.
This has suggested the recommendation to strip the
other kinds also of their leaves, so as to make them
grow to heads rather than run to seed. Ascalon
onions also have a peculial· nature, being in a manner
sterile at the root, and consequently the Greeks have
advised growing them from seed and not planting
thern, and moreover sowing them rather late, about
spring—time. but transplanting them when they are in
bud; this method, they say, causes thern to fill out
and grow quickly‚ making up for the time lost. But
in their case haste is necessary, because when ripe
they quickly go rotten. If grown from roots they
throw out a stalk and run to seed, and the bulb
withers away. There is also a difference of colours,
the whitest onions growing at Issus and at Sardis.
Those of Crete are also estecmed, though the
question is raised whether they arc identical with ilie
Ascalon variety, because when grown from seed they
make large heads but run to stall< and seed when
