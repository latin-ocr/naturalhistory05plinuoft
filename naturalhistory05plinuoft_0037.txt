also the vines have begun to be nipped, which did not
occur before3 while on the other hand the city of
Aenos, since the river Maritza was brought near to it,
has expcrienced an increase ofwarmtha and the district
round Philippi altered its climate when its land under
cultivation was drained. On the other hand on land
belonging to Syracuse a farmer who was a newcomer to
the district by removing the stones from the soil caused
his crops to be ruined by mud, until he carried the
stones back again. In Syria they use a light plough-
share that cuts a narrow furrow, because the sub-
soil is rock which causes the seeds to be scorched
in summer.

Again, immoderate heat and cold have a similar So itam!
effect in certain places. Thrace owes its fertility in czzmase
corn to cold, Africa and Egypt to heat. There isone
place in the island of Chalcia belonging to Rhodes
which is so fertile that they reap barley sown at its
proper time and after carrying it at once sow the field
again and reap a second crop of barley with the other
harvest. In the district of Venafrum a gravel soil is
found to be most suitable for olives, but in Baetica a
very rich soil. The vines os Pucinum b are scorched on
rock, whereas those of Caecubum grow in the dalnp
ground of the Pontine Marshes. So much variety
and diversity obtains in the evidence of experience
and in soil. V opiscus Caesar when appearing
in a case before the Censors spoke of the plains of
Rosia as ‘the paps of Italy' , where stakes left
lying on the ground the day before were hidden
with grass; but these plains are only valued for
pasture. Neverthcless Nature did not wish that we
should bc uninstructed, and has caused crrors to be
fully admitted even where she had not given clear
