by layering. Democritus tells us that the Taranto
myrtle is also grown in another way: the largest
berries are taken, and after being crushed lightly so
as not to break the pips <are mixed into a paste with
water>⁰ and this is pounded up and smeared on a rope,
which is then put in the ground; from this, he says,
will grow up a remarkably thick hedge, from which
slips can be transplanted. They also grow brambles
for hedges in the sarne way, by srnearing a rope of
rushes with blackberries. In case of scm-city? laurel
and myrtle seeds are ready for transfer at the end of

Among the trees that are grown from seed, Mago
deals elaborately with those& of the nut class He
says that 1116 almond should be sown in soft cla3 soil
vnth a south aspect, but that it also does well 1n h ard
warm gr,ound but in ’1 11611 or damp soil it dies or

is being grown from berries. The citron is grown
from pips and from layers, and the sorb from seed or
