possible to be hopeful about our own morals.⁰ But
Columella ὁ puts manure from dovecots first, and next
manure from the poultry-yard. condemning the drop-
pings of water birds entirely. The rest of the author-
ities advocate the residue of human banquets as one of
the best manures‚ and some of them place even higher
the residue of men’s drink‚ with hair found in curriers’
shops soaked in it, while others recommend this liquor
by itself, after water has been again mixed with it and
even in larger quantity than when the wine is being
drunk ⁶ ; the fact being that a larger amount of bad-
ness has to be overcome in the liquor when to the
original poison of the wine the human factor has been
added. These are contested questions3 and they
use man even for nourishing soil. Next to this
kind of manure the dung of swine is highly com-
mended Columella ἆ alone condemning it. Others
recommend the dung of any quadruped that feeds
on cytisuS‚ but some prefer pigeons' droppings.
Next comes the dung of goats, after that sheeps’
dung, then cow—dung and last of all that of beasts
of burden.

These distinctions were recognized in early days,
and at the same time I do not find modern rules for
the use of dung, since in this matter also old times
are more serviceable3 and before now in some parts
of the provinces there has been so large and valuable
a supply of beasts that the practice has been seen
of passing dung through a sievc‚ like flour, the
stench and look of it being transformed by the action
of time into something actually attractive. (It has
lately been found that olives particularly thrive on
ashes from a lime kiln.)e To the rules given Varro!
