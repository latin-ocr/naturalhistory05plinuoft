pounds of bread‚ that of the Italian kind two or three
pounds more, in the case of bread baked in a tin—for
loaves baked in the oven they add two pounds in
either kind of wheat.

⁵ Hard ’ floura is made from hard wheat. the most
highly esteemed coming from Africa. A fair return is
half a peck from a peck with five sixteenths of special
flour—that is the name given in the case ofhard wheat
to what in common wheat is called the ¹ flower ' ς this is
used in copper works and paper mills—and in addi-
tion four sixteenths of second quality floui· and the
same amount os bran, but from a peck of ‘ hard ’ flour
22 pounds of bread and from a peck of flowcr of
wheat 16 pounds. The price for this when the
market rate is moderate is 40 asses a pcck for flour,
8 asses more for ‘ hard ’ flour and twice as much for
bolted common wheat. There is also another distinc-
tion, that when bolted a single time it gives 17 pounds
of bread, when twice 18, when three times 193, and
2} pounds of second quality bread, the same amount
of shorts and six sixtccnths of bran.

Common wheat never ripens evcnly, and yet no corn ‘mum ι

crop is less able to stand delay as, owing to its
delicacy of structure, the ears that have ripened
shed their grain at once. But it is less exposed
to danger in the straw than other cereals, because
it always has the ear on a straight stall< and it
does not hold dew to cause rust. Bcst emmer makes
the sweetest bread; the grain itsclf is of closer
fibre than ordinary emmer and the ear is at once larger
and heavier: a pcck of the grain seldom fails to
make 16 pounds. In Greece it is difficult to thrcsh
and consequcntly Homerb speaks of it as being
fed to cattle—sor his word olyra means this grain3
