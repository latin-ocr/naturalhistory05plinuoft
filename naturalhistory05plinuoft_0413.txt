help must be afforded to the understanding even of
persons unacquainted with the subject: the rule is
to examine the position of the sun at noon, as that
is always the same, whereas the sunrise is at a
different point in the sky every day from where it
was yesterday, so nobody must suppose that the right
plan is to take a line on sunrise.

Having thus worked out a part of the heavens,
the end of the line next to north on the east side of
it will give the point of sunrise at the summer solstice‚
that is on the longest day, and the position of the
north-east ‘² wind, the Greek name for which is Boreas. *verm-eas!

Be taught in advance: some conditions are good for
strong full- -grown trees and others for saplings. (Nor

softened by the sun, and changes its name—it is
called Etesias. Consequently be on your guard
when you feel the wind cold, and when a north-

than a wind due north. North-east is the direction
in which the trees and vines should face in Asia,
Graece, Spain, the coastal parts of Italy, Campania
and Apulia. Breeders who desire to get male stock-
