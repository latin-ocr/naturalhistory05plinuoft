foam that forms on the surface in the process is used
for leaven‚ in consequence of which those races have
3 lighter kind of bread than others. There is also a
difference in the stalk, that of the better sort of grain
being thicker. Thracian wheat is elothed with a
great many husks, which is necessary for that region
because of the exeessive frosts. 'Ihe same reason
has also led to the discovery of 3 th1 ee —rnonth wheat‚
because the snow holds back the ground3 it is
reaped about three months⁰ after sowing, at the
same ‘time as wheat is harvested in the rest of
the world. This wheat is known all over the Alps,
and in the provinces with eold elimatos no corn
flourishes better than this3 moreover it has a single
stem and in no region holds much grain, and it is
never sown except in 3 thin soil. There is actually
a two—mouth variety in the neighbourhood of Aenus
in Thrace, which begins to ripen six weeks after it is
sown 3 and it is surprising that no corn weighs beavier,
and that it produces no bran. It is also used in
Sicily and Achaia, in both cases in mountain dis-
tricts, and in Euboea in the neighbourhood of
Carystus. So greatly is Columella 111istaken in his [s. 9. 8.
opinion that even three-mouth wheat is not a
distinct variety, although it is of extreme antiquity.
The Greeks call it setanionJ’ It is said that in
Bactria the grains of wheat grow so large that a
single grain is as big as our ears of corn.C
