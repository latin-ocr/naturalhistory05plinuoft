and in shut-in valleys that have no current of air
through them, whereas windy places and high ground
on the contrary are free from it. Among the vices
of corn is also over-abundance, when the stalks fall
down under the bul-den of fertility. But a vice
common to all cultivated crops is caterpillars‚ which
even attack chick—pea when rain makes it 'caste
sweeter by washing away its saltness.
There is a weed that kills off chick-pea and bitter
vetch by binding itself round them, called orobanche⁶;
and in a similar way wheat is attacked by darnel,
barley by a long-stalked plant called aegilops and
lentils by an axe-leaved plant b which the Greeks call
axe-grass from its resemblance; these also kill the
plants by twining round them. In the neighbour-
hood of Philippi ⁶ they give the name of ateramum
to a weed growing in rich soil that kills the bean
plant, and the name teramum to one that has the same
effect in thin soil, when a particular wind has been
blowing on the beans when damp. Darnel has a very
small seed enclosed in a prickly husk. When used in
bread it very quic-kly causes fits of giddiness, and it
is said that in Asia and Greece when the managers
of baths want to get rid of a crowd they throw darnel
seed on to hot coals. Also the phalangium, a little
creature of the spider class, breeds in bitter vetch, if
there is a wet winter. Slugs breed amongst veteh, and
sometimes small snails which are produced from the
ground and eat away the vctch in a surprising manner.
——These broadly speaking are the diseases of grain.
