side banked up as well. Some of these holes will
be made longer, so as to take two vines at opposite
ends, and these will be called beds. The root of the
vine should be in the middle of the hole, but the
slip itself, bedded in firm soil, should be pointing
due east, and at first it should be given supports
made of reed. Vineyards should bc bisected by a
main path running east and west, six yards wide so
as to allow the passage of carts going in opposite
directions; and they should be intersectcd by other
cross-paths ten feet wide running through the middle
of each acre, or, if the vineyard is a specially large
one, it should have a main cross-path north and south
as many feet wide as the one east and west, but
always be divided up by fifth-row cross-paths—-that
is, so that each square ‘² of vines may be enclosed by
every fisthb stay. Where the soil is heavy it should
only be planted after being dug over several times,
and only quickset should be planted, but in a thin,
loose soil even a mallet-shoot may be set in a hole
or a furrOW. On hill-sides it is better to drive furrows
across the slope than to dig up the soil, so that the
falling away of earth may be held up by the cross-
banks formed by the furrows. In rainy conditions or
dry soil when the weather is wet mallet—shoots are best
planted in autumn, unless the character ofthc particu-
lar area requires otherwise : a dry and hot soil will call
for autumn planting, but a damp and cold soil will need
it as late as the end of spring. It is no good planting
a quickset either in dry soil, nor is· it much use to
plant a mallet-shoot in dry soils either, except after
rain, but in well watered soils a vine may properly
be planted even whcn it is producing leaves, and right
on to midzummvr, as is the practic‹¹ in Spain. It is
