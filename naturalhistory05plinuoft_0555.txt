rosemary. Alexanders is a garden herb that grows
in the same places, and its root has the taste of myrrh.
Pepperwort grows in the same way. The remaining
plants are peculiar in both scent and taste, for example
anise ; and so great is their diversity and their potency
that not only is one of them modified by another but
it is entirely counteracted: cooks use parsley to
remove the tang of vinegar from their dishes, and
parsley enclosed in bags is also employed by butlers
to rid wine of disagreeable odour.

And so far we have spoken about garden plants Medic “te-⁴1²³
merely as providing articles of diet. There stillfolsslssm
remains indeed a most important operation of natule
in the same depalmtment ίι]·ιςηιιιοὴ as hitherto we
have only treated of their produce and given cer-
tain summary outlines3 whereas the true nature of
each plant can only be fully understood by studying
its medicinal effect, that vast and recondite work of
divine power, and the greatest subject that can
possibly be found. Due regard for method has led
us not to combine with each object in successim] the
question of its medicinal value, because a different
set of people are concerned with the requiremcnts of
medical practice, and either topic would have met
with long interruptions if we had mixed the two
together. As it is, each subject will occupy its own
section, and any who wish will be able to combine

them.
