that exists in Campania' is not the best soil for vines
everywhere, nor is a soil that emits thin clouds of
vapom, nor the red earth that many writers have
praised. The chalky soil in the territory of Alba
Pompeia and a clay soil are preferred to all the other
kinds for vines, although they are very rich, a quality
to which exception is made in the case of that class of
plants. Conversely the white sand in the Ticino dis-
trict, and the black sand found in many places, and
likewise red sand, even when intermingled with rich
soil, are unproductive. The signs adduced in judging
soil are often misleading. A soil in which lofty trees
do brilliantly is not invariably favourable except for
those trees: for what grows higher than a silver fir?
yet what other tree could have lived in the same
place? Nor do luxuriant pastures always indicate a
rich soil ι for what is more famous than the pastui-es of
Germany? but immediately underneath a very thin
skin ofturfthere is sand. And land where plants grow
high is not always damp, any more, I protest, than
soil that sticks to the fingers is always rich-—a fact that
is proved in the case of clay soils. In point of fact no
soil when put back into the holes out of which it is dug
completely fills them, so as to make it possible to
detect a close soil and a loose soil in this mannen
and all soil covers iron with rust.⁰ Nor can a heavy
