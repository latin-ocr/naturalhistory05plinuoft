BOOK XVIII. vn. 32-34

Scaevola’s farmhouse would not hold the produce of
his farm and Lucullus’s farm was not big enough for
his house-—a sort of extravagance that occasioned
the censor's rebuke that there was less ground to
plough than floor-space to sweep. The proper
arrangement requires a certain amount of teehnical
skill. Quite recently Gaius Marius, who was seven
times consul, built a country house in the district of
Miseno, but he relied on the skill he had acquired
in planning the lay-out of a camp, so that even Sulla ‘¹
the Fortunate declared that all the others had been
blind men in comparison with Marius. It is agreed
that a country house ought not to be put near a
marsh n01 with a river in front of it—although
Homer has stated with the greatest truth that in
any case ὁ there are always unhealth3 currents of iir
rising from a liver before da3vn.111 hot localities
the house should look north, in cold ones south and
in temper· ite situations due east.

As to proofs b3 uhich the quality of the land
itself c an be judged, 33e m ty possibly be thought to
ha3e spoken of these uith sufficient fullness t>when
discussing the best kind of soil, but nevertheless we
will still supplement the indications we have given by
some words of Cat0⁶ more particularly: ‘The dane-
wort or the 33ild plum or tho bramble‚ the small-
bulb, trefoiL meadow grass, oak, wild pears and wild
apple are indications of a soil fit for corn, as also is
black or ash— coloured earth. All chalk land 33ill
scorch the crop unless it is an extremely thin
soil, and so will sand unless it also is extremely
fine; and the same soils answer much better for
plantations on level ground than for those on a
slope.'
