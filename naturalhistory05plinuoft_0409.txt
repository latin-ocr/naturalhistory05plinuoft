on any given day, let people stand at midday so as to ιοζ {fjffl'ffi

then they will have the south directly in front of ⁸
thern and the north directly behind the1n; a path
running through a field in this way will be called a
cardinal line. It is better then to turn round, so as
to be able to see your own shad0w‚ which will other-

flanks, so as to have the sunrise of that day at your
right shoulder and the sunset at your left, it will be

hoe or make a line with ashes let us say 20 ft. long,
and at the centre of this line, that is 10 ft. from each
end, to draw a small circle, which may be called the
umbilicus or navel. The part of the line towards
the head of the shadow will bc in the direction of
the north wind. You who prune trees, do not let the
cut ends of them face in that direction. nor should
trees carrying vines or vines themselves do so except
in the province of Africa, in the Cyrenaica and in

fine weather. In Italy bearing branches should face
