but at thc same time to be a wise arrangement to let
them catch the wind from that quarter sideways,
because it moderates the heat of summer in those
regions, although it usually bloxx s w ith such violence as
to carry away the roofs of houses. Some people make
the question of aspect depend on the nature of the
soil, letting vines planted in dry situations face east
and north and those in a damp one south. Moreover,
they borrow rules from the vines themselves, by plant—
ing early varieties in cold situations, so that their
ripening may come before the cold weather‚ and fruit-
trees and vines that dislike dew, with an eastern
aspect, so that the sun may carry off the moisture at
once, but those that like dew, facing west or even north,
so that they may enjoy it for a longer time. But the
rest, virtually following Nature 5 sy stem, have recom-
mended that vines and trees should be placed so as to
face north- east; and Democritus is of opinion that
the fruit so grown also has more scent. W'e have

dealt in Book Two m'th positions facing north-east and .

the other quarters‚ and we shall give more meteoro—

logical details in the next Book. In the meantime¹
a clear test of the healthiness of the aspect seems to ⁰·

lie in the fact that trees facing south are always the
first to shed their leaves. A similar influence also
operates in maritime districts: sea breezes ale in-
jurious in some places, while at the same time in most
places they encourage grow th3 and some plants like
having a distant view of the sea but are not benefited
by being moved nearer to its saline exhalations. A
similar principle applies also to rivers and marshes:
they shrivel up vegetation by their mists or else they
serve to σου] excessively hot districts. The trees
