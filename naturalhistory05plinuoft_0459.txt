brought down seed from Tiara: that is the place
where most grow. The most famous Asiatic truffles
grow round Lampsacus and Alopeconnesus, and the
most famous Greek ones in the district of Elis.

XIV. The fungus class also includes those called by
the Greeks pesicae⁵ which grow without root or stalk

XV. Next after these we will speak about laser-
wort, a remarkably important plant, the Greek
name for which is silphium3 it was originally found
in the province of Cyrenaica. ItsJuice is c 1lled laser,
and it takes an important place in general use and
among drugs, and is sold for its weight in silver denarii.
It has not been found 1n that country now for many
y ears, because the tax· farmers who rent the pasturage
strip it clean by grazing sheep on it, realizing that
they make more profit in that way. Only a single
stalk has been found there within our memory, which
was sent to the Emperor Nero. Ifa grazing flock ever
chances to come on a promising young shoot‚ this is
detected by the indication that 3 sheep after eating it
at once goes to sleep and 3 goat has a fit of sneezing.
And for a long time now no laserwort has been
imported to us except what grows in Persia or Media
and Armenia, in abundant quantity but much inferior
quality to that of Cyrenaica, and even so adulterated
with gum, sacopemum, or with crushed bean83 this
makes it even more necessary for us not to omit to
state the facts that in the consulship of Gaius
Valerius and ¹ Marcus Herennius, 30 pounds of
laserwort plant was imported to Rome by the
government, and that during the dictatorship of
Caesar, at the beginning of the civil war he produced
out of the treasury together with gold and silver
1500 lbs. of laserwort plant.
