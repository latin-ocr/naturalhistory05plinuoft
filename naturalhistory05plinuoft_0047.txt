chiefly used in Britain. Its effect lasts for 80 years,
and there is no case of anybody having scattered it on
the same land twice in his lifetime. A third kind of
white marl is called glisomarga‚ · this is fullers' chalk
intermixed with a greasy earth, and it is 3 111010 effec-

a crop of corn has been carried, before the next
sowing a very abundant crop of hay can be cut,

although while grou ing corn the land does not produce

Segni plaster does. For dove-coloured marl the

The Aedui and the Pictones have made their arable
land extremely fertile by means of chalk, which is
indeed also found most useful for olives and vines.
