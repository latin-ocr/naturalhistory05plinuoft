known of them and the most prevalent are emmer
(the old name for which was adoreum), common whcat
and hard wheat-these are common to most countrics.
Arincaa wheat which is indigenous in the Gallie
provinces is also frequent in Italy3 while zea, olyra,
and ⁴ rice’ or tiplze') are only found in Egypt, Syria,
Cilicia and Asia and Greece. Egypt makes a prime
flour out of its own wheat, but it by no means matches
that of Italy. The places that use zea have not got
our emmer. Zea also is found in Italy, particularly
in Campania, and is called ‘ seed '; it has that name as
being a remarkable thing, as we shall soon explain, ,εξ 112, iffi.

aroma, ‘ the tilth that gives us zea ’—it is not on
account of its ‘ bestowing life ’‚ as some people think.
Stareh ofa coarser quality than the kind mentioned be-
fore but otherwise identical is made from it. Emmer
is the most hardy of every kind and the one that
resists winter best. It stands the coldest locali-
ties and those that are under-cultivated or extremely
hot and dry. It was the first food of the Latium of
old times, a strong proof of this being found 111 the
offerings of adoria, as we have said. It is clem-§1⁴-
however that for a long time the Romans lived 011
pottage, not on bread, since even to-day foodstuffs
are also called ‘ pulmentaria ’, and Ennius, the oldest
of our bards, describing a famine during a siege, re-
calls how fathers snatchcd away a morscl from their
crying children. Even nowadays primitive rituals
and birthday sacrifices arc performed with gruel-
pottage; and it appears that pottage was as much
unknown to Greece as pearl-barley was to Rome.

Latin sar was properly ζειὰ δίκοκκος, but Pliny missos this
point.
