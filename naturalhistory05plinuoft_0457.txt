in their colom, which is red or black, and the inside

whether they grow in size, or whether this bleinish of
the earth—for they cannot be understood as anything
else—forms at once a ball of the size that it is going

biting a truffle to come on a denarius contained inside

ground flooded by the rivers, when the floods have
