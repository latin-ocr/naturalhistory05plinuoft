of the same depth. It is proper to cut rods from it
in about three years, · but these also fill up the place
of trees that are growing old, by means of a lay e1ed
new growth cut off astera ye 1¹1¹. 'X single acre of
osier- -1n'llow will supply enough for 25 acres of vine-
yard. The white poplar is also grown for the same
purpose, the hole being two feet deep and 1116 cutting
eighteen inches long and left two days to dry3 the
truncheons are planted onc foot nine inches apart and a
layer ofearth a yard deep is thrown on the top of them.
XXXIII. The reed likes an even moister soil than Reed-

osiers do. It is planted by putting the bulb of the
root, which others call the ‘ eye ’‚ in a 11016 111116 inches
deep, two feet six inches apart; and it renews itself
of its own accord when an old reed-bed has been
rooted up, a method that has been found to pay
better than thinning out, as used to be done pre-
viously, because the roots get twisted up together
and are killed by their mutual inroads. The time
to plant is before the eyes of the reeds swell up,
which is before the first of March. It goes on grow-
ing till midwinter, and stops when it is beginning
to get hard, which is the indication that it is ready
for cutting3 though it 15 thought that the reed also
requires digging round ·15 often as the vine does. It
is also planted in a hori7ontal position, not bulied
deep in the ground, and as many 5110015 spring up as
there are eyes. It is also grown by being planted
out in a hole a foot deep, with two eyes buried so
that the third knot is just touching the earth, and
with the head bent down so as not to hold the dew,
It is cut when the moon is on the wane. For prop-
ping vines a reed dried in smoke is more serviceable
th'an one still green.
