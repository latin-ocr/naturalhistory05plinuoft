while in black earth he advises a hole 3 ft. 4 in. deep,
in the form osa square of the same dimensions. The
Greek authorities agree that the holes ought not to be
more than 2} ft. deep or 2 ft. wide, but nowhere less
than 18 111. deep. Because of the fact that in (lamp
ground one gets through to the neighbourhood of
water, Catoss advises that if the place 13 damp the
holes should be 3 yard wide at the orifice and 16
11161163 wide at the bottom, and 4 ft. deep, and that
they should bc floored with 3101163, or, if 3101163 are
not available, with stakes of green willow, or, if these
are also not available, with brushwood, so as to reduce
their depth by six inches. To us, after what has been
said as to the nature of trees, it appears proper to add
that those which are fond of the surface of the ground,
for instance the ash and the olive, must be sunl< dceper
iu; these and similar trees should be sunl< four feet
down, but for the others a depth of three feet will be
enough. And there is no 1131111 in trimming the parts
that have become exposed: ‘ Lop clear that root

date the chief magistrate of Palestrina he ordered
the lictor to draw his axe.⁶ Some persons recom-
mend putting at the bottom a layer of potshcrds—
others prefer round stones-——in order to hold in the
moisture and also let some through, thinking that
flat stones do not act in the same way and prevent
the root from reaching the earth. A middle course
between the two opinions· would be to pave the
bottom with a layer of gravel.
