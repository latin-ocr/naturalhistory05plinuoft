she will bring rain at full moon. If when full 5116 has
a circle round her, it will denote wind in the quarter
where the circle shincs brightest, and if at her rising
the horns are thicker, it will denote a terrible storm.
If when there is a west wind blowing the moon does
not make an appearance before her fourth day, 5116

whole month. If on her sixteenth day 5116 has a
more violently flaming appearance, this will presage
violent storms.'

There are also eight periodic points of thc moon
herself, corresponding to her angles of incidencc with

prognostics between those points; they are the 3rd,
7th, llth‚ l5th‚ 19th‚ 23rd and 27th days of the moon,
and the day of her conjunction.

a fine and cold autumn. If spring and summer do
not pass without a chilly period, they will cause a fine
and misty autumn, with less wind. Fine weather in
autumn makes a windy winter. When the bright-
ness of the stars becomes suddenly obscured, and that
not by cloud or mist, rain or heavy storms are threat-

announce winds from the quarters in the direction of
which they travel‚ making a white track‚ steady winds
if the stars twinkle‚ but if this occurs in several
parts of the sky, shifting winds and blowing from all
quarters. If one of the planets is enclosed by a
