There are two kinds of layer. A branch is bent
down from the tree into a hole measuring four fcet
each way, and after two years is cut offat the bend, and
three years later the growth is transplanted to another
place; ifit is desired to carry layers so struck a con-
siderable distance, it is most suitable to plant them at
once in baskets or earthenware pots, so that they may
be carried to the fresh site in these. The other
method is more elaborate3 it is effected by inducing
roots to grow on the tree itself by passing branches
through earthenware pots or baskets and packing
them round with earth, and so enticing roots to grow
right among the fruit and at the ends of the branches
—as branch-ends to form roots iu this way are
obtained at the top of the tree‚ by the dal-ing device
of creating another tree a long way off the ground—
and after the same interval of two years as in the
previous method cutting off the layer and planting it
together with the basket. Savine is grown from a
lay er and also from a slip; it is said th at wine· -lees or
crushed brick from walls make it grow marv ellously;
and rosemary is reproduced by the same methods
and also from a branch‚ since neither savine nor
rosemary has a seed; the olcander is grown both
by lay erintr and from seed.

XXII. Nature has also taught the method of graft—
ing by means of seed; a seed that has been hurriedly
sw allowed whole by a hunffry bird and has become
sodden by the w armth ofits belly is depositcd toge ther
with a fertilizing manure of dung 1n a soft bed in the
fork of a tree, or else, as often happens, is carried
by the wind into some crevice or other in the bark;
as a result of this we have seen a cherry tree growing
on a willow, a plane on a laurel‚ a laurel on a cherry,
