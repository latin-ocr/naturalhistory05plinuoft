beneficial if the scars widen out and fill up with new
wood growing between their edges3 XLIII. and to
a large extent the medical treatment of trees re-
sembles that of human beings, as the bones of trees
also are treated by perforation.⁰ Bitter almonds are
made into sw eet ones if the stem of the tree h as the
earth dug axx ay round it and a ring of holes pierced
in it at the bottom, and then the gum exuding is
wiped off. Also elms can be relieved of useless sap
by having holes pierced in them above the level of the
earth right into the cambium when they are getting
old, or w hen they are observ ed to be receiving exces-
sive nourishmcnt. The sap is also discharged from
the bark of figs when sw ollen by means of light cuts
made on a slant3 this treatment prevents the fruit
from falling off. Frujt-trees that make buds but pro-
duce no fruit are treated by making a cleft in the
root and inserting a stone in it, and this makes them
bear; and the same result' is produced m almonds bv
driving in a w edge of hard oak‚ and in pears and

and covering up the hole with ashes and earth. It
also pays to cut round the roots of vines and figs¹
when over-luxuriant and to put ashes on the cut
parts. Late figs are produced if those of the first
crop are picked off the tree still unripe, when they
are a little larger than a bean, as a second crop
grows which ripens later. Also fig- t-rees are made
stronger and more productive if the tips of all the
branches are docked when they begin to make
