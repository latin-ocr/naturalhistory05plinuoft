forbid sowing wheat except in land that has lain
fallow the ) ear before.

one thing known to eun body is that the land must
not be sown unless it has been manuiffed although
ev en this matter has< special rules applying to it. You
must not sow millet, panio, turnip or navew except
in ground that has been manurcd, but if thc ground
has not been manured‚ you should sow wheat in it
rather than barley. Similarly also in the case of
fallows‚ although it is held that in these beans should
be sowed, in every case you must sow that crop after
the soil has been manured as recently as possible.
A person intending to sow something in the autumn
should pile dung on the land in September, at all
events after rain has fallen3 but if intending to sow
in the spring-time, he should spread dung during
the winter—eighteen loads of dung is the proper
amount to be given to an acre; but be careful not to
spread it before plougliing. But after the seed has
been sown‚ if this m anuring thas been neglected‚ the
following stage is, before you w eed, first to scatter
like seed some dust of droppings obtained from
hen-coops. But to fix a precise limit for this
treatment also, the right amount is to get one load
of manure per head of smaller animals and ten loads
per head of oxen. If that be not forthcoming, it
would look as if the farmcr had been slack in providing
litter for his stock. Some people think that manur-
ing is best done by keeping the ilocks and herds
permanently out of doors penned up with nctting.
