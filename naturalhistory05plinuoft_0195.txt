and made to ripen by applying lime to the roots3
but with eherries also, as with all fruit, it is better
to thin the crop, in order to make the fruit lest on

salt, but it acts more gently; consequently they
are sprinkled on figs and on rue, to prevent their
getting maggotty or rotting at the roots. It is also
advised to pour salt water on the roots of vines if they
are too full of moisture, but if their fruit falls off, to
sprinkle ashes with vinegar and smear them on the
vines themselves, or ashes with sandarach if the
grapes rot; but if the vines do not bear, to sprinkle
and smear them with ashes mixed with strong vine·
gar ; and if they do not ripen their fruit but let it dry
up first, the vines should be lopped down to the roots
and the wound and fibres of the wood drenched with
strong vinegar and stale urine and covered up with
the mud so produced, and repeatedly dug round.

If olives give too little promise of fruit, growers bare
their roots and expose them to the winter cold, and

the trees profit by this drastic treatment. All these
methods depend on the state of thc weather in each
year and sometimes are required later and some-
times more speedily. Also sire is beneficial for some
plants, for instance reeds, which when burnt off grow

up again thicker and more pliable. Cato moreover Χρῐη,
