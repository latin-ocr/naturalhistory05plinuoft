of the most famous authorities on medical scienee,
has devoted one whole book to its praises. Utica
barley-water is of outstanding quality. There is a
kind in Egypt made of the double-pointed grain.
The kind of barley used for making this drink
in Andalusia and Africa is called by Turranius
smooth barley. The same authority is of opinion
that olyra,“ and oryza (rice) are the same plant.
The recipe for making barley-water is universally
known.

XVI. Hulled—wheat grain is used in a similar way Staret·-
for making pap, at all events in Campania and in
Egypt3 XVII. and starch is made from every kind of
wheat and common wheat‚⁶ but the best from three·
month wheat. For its discovery we are indebted to the
island of Chios, and that is where the best kind comes
from to-day. Its name ⁶ is Greek, and means ‘ made
without milling’. Next to the starch made from
three-month wheat is the kind made of the lightest
sort of wheat. This is soaked with fresh water in
wooden tubs, with the grain completely covered,
the water being changed five times in the course of
a day, and preferably in the night time as well, so
as to get it mixed up evenly with the grain. When
it is quite soft but before it goes sour it is strained
through linen or wicker baskets and poured out on
a tiled surfaee that has been smeared with leaven,
and left to thicken in the sun. Next to the
starch of Chios that from Crete is most highly
spoken of; and then comes the Egyptian kind.
Thc test of its quality is smooth consistency and
light weight, and the condition of being fresh.
It has moreover been mentioned already by Catod
among ourselves.
