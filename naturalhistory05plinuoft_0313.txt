the share turns the turves over3 men at once scatter
the seed on it and draw toothed harrows over the
furrows. Fields that have been sown in this way do
not need hoeing‚ but this method of ploughing re-
quires teams of two or three pairs of oxen. It is a
fair estimate for forty acres of easy soil and thirty
of difficult to be rated as a year’s work for one team
of oxen.

XLIX. In ploughing it is extremely important to
obey the oracular utterance of Cato: ‘ What is good
fai-ming? Good ploughing. What is second best?
Ploughing. What third? Manuring.' ‘ Do not plough
a crooked furrow. Plough in good time? In com-
paratively mild places breaking the ground should
begin at midxn'nter, but in colder districts at the
spring equin0x3 and it should begin earlier in a dry
region than in a damp one, and earlier in a dense
soil than a loose one and in a rich soil than in a poor
one. &Vhere the summers are dry and oppressive
and the land chalky or thiu, it pays better to plough
between midsummer and the autumnal equinox, but
in the middle of the hot weather in places where
summer heat is moderate, rainfalls frequent and the
soil rich and grassy. It is the rule to stir a deep
heavy soil even in the winter, but a very thin and
dry one a little before sowing.

Ploughing also has rules of its own ; Do not touch
a muddy soil. Plough with all your might. Break
the ground before you plough. The value of the
last process is that turning the turf kills the roots of
the weeds. Some people recommend beginning to
break the ground at all events at the spring equinox.
Land ploughed once in spring is called ‘ spring-
worked land ’, from the fact of the date3 spring-
