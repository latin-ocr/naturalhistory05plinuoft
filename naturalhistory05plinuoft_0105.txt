The man who stirs over his olive-yard most often
and deepest, will plough up the thinnest roots. If
he ploughs badly, the roots will spread out on the

We have already stated, in treating of olive· oil, Semastmss
what kinds of olive trees Cato tells us Dto plant and„ ἵζ’ “⁷²¹²'‘ ⁷²⁹
in what kind of soil, and w hat aspect he advises for [ΧΨ- 2οΠ
oliv-e -yards. Mago recommends that on sloping
ground and in dry positions and in a clay soil they
should be planted between autumn and the middle
of winter, but in heavy or damp or watery soil be-
tween harvest and the middle of winter-though it
must be understood that he gave this advice for
Africa. Italy at any rate, at the present time, does
its planting chiefly in spring, but if one chooses to
plant in autumn as well, there are only sour days of
the forty between the equinox and the setting of the
Pleiads on which it injures olives to be planted. It
is peculiar to Africa that it grafts them on a wild
olive, in a sort of everlasting sequence, as when they
begin to get old the shoot next for engrafting is put
in and so another young tree grows out of the same
one and the process is repeated as often as is neces-
sary, so that the same olive-yards go on for genera-
tions. The wild olive however is propagated both
by grafting and by inoculation.

It is bad to plant an olive where an oak—tree has
been dug up, because the worms called raucae breed
in oak roots and go over to olives. It has been ascer-
tained to pay better not to bury the cuttings in the
ground or to dry them before they are planted. It
has been found better for an old olive-yard to be
