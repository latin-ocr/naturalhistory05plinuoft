remedy against ants, which are not the least dc structive
of pests in gardens not well supplied with w ·1ter; the

immoriel. It is stated that if cabbage seed is soaked
in the juice of houseleek before being sown, the cab-
bages will be' immune from all kinds of insects3 and
it is said that caterpillars can be totally extermin·1ted
in gardens by fixing up on a stake the skull of an
animal of the horse class, provided it is that of a
female. There is also a story that a river crab hung
up in the middle of a garden is a protection against
caterpillars. Some people touch plants which they
want to be immune from caterpillars with slips of
blood-red cornel. Also gnats infest damp gardens,
especially if there are any shrubs' 1n them; these can
be driven away by burning galbanum resin.
