at the four corners of the field, with the remarkable
result that no bird whatever will enter it. Mice are
driven away by sprinkling the seed with the ashes
of a weasel or a cat dissolved in water or with water
in which those animals have been boiled; but their
poison makes an odour even in bread, aud conse-
quently it is thought more satisfactory to steep the
seed in ox-gall. As for the greatest curse of corn,
mildew, fixing branchos of laurel in the ground makes
it pass out of the fields into their foliage.<¹ Excessive
luxuriance in corn-crops is corrected by grazing cattle
on them, provided the corn is still in the blade, and
although it is eaten down even several times it
suffers no injury in the ear. It is absolutely certain
that if the ears are lopped off even once the grain
becomes longer in shape and hollow inside and worth-
less, and if sown does not grow. Nevertheless at
Babylon they cut the corn twice and the third time
pasture it off with cattle, as otherwise it would make
only leaves. Even so the exceptional fertility of the
soil returns crops with a fifty-sold increase, and to
more industrious farmers even with a hundredfold.
Nor is there any difficulty in the niethod of letting
the ground be under water as long as possible, in
order that its extremely rich and substantial fertility
may be (liluted. But the Euphrates and the 'I‘igris
do not carry mud on to the land in the same way as
the Nile does in Egypt, nor does the soil itsclf produce
vegetation3 but nevertheless its fertilily is so great
that a second crop grows of its own accord in the
following year from the seed< troddcn in by the
reapch. This extreme difference of soil prompts me
to distribute my description of the various kinds of
land among the different crops.
