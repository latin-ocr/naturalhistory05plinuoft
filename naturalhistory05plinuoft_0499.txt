stom seed, but as a matter of fact they spring up
of themselves in the plains near Palestrina, and
also in unlimited quantity in the country round
Reims.

XXXI. Nearly all kitchen-garden plants have Variecfes os
only a single root, for instance radish, beet, parsley‚⁰ srffiss'as “nd
mallow. Sorrel has the largest root, going as far as a
yard and a half into the ground (the root of the wild
sorrel is smaller)‚ and its root is full of sap, and lives
a long time even after being dug up. In some of
these plants‚ however‚for instance parsley and mallow‚
the root is fibrous, in some, for instance basil,
woody, in others fleshy, as in beet or still more in
saffron, and with some, for instance radish and turnip‚
the roots consist of rind and flesh, and the roots of
some, for instance hay—grass, are jointed. Those
which have not a straight root support themselves
immediately with a great many hairy fibres‚ for
instance orage and blite; but squill and the bulbs
and onion and garlic only throw out straight roots.
Some of the plants that grow sels-sown have more
root than leaf, for instance ,ςραῐααηὸ partridge-plant
and crocus. Wild thyme‚ southernwood‚ navews,
radishes‚ mint and rue blossom all in a bunch. All
other plants shed their blossom all at once as soon as
they have begun to do so, but basil does so gradually,
starting from the bottom, and consequently it
flowers for a very long time. This also happens
in the case of the heliotrope. Some plants have a
white flower‚ others yellow and others purple. Wild
marjoram and elecampane shed their leaves from the
top down, and so sometimes does rue when it has been
damaged by an accident. The onion and the getion-
leek have especially hollow leaves.
