and smearing it round it. From his remarks on the
subject it is easily seen that at that period they used
to insert the graft between the wood and the bark
and not otherwise, nor used they to put the slips
more than two inches in. He advises grafting pear seasons ssor
and apples during the spring and fifty days after V'as‘m‘l·
midsummer and after the vintage, but olives and figs
only in the spring and when a cloudless moon is
shining, and moreover in the afternoon and not if
there is a south wind blowing. It is remarkable
that he is not content to have safeguarded the graft
in the manner described, and to have protected
it against rain and frost by means of turf and
soft bundles of split osiers, but he says it must be
covered with a lay er of bugloss—a species of plant—-
as w‚ell and that this should be tied on with a layer
of straw3 whereas nowadays they think it is very
adequately packed with a wrapping of mud and
chaff‚ the graft projecting two inches from the bark.
Those who do their grafting in spring are pressed
for time, as the buds are just shooting‚ except in
the case of the olive, the eyes of which are pregnant
for a very long time, and it has a very small amount
of sap under the bark, which when too abundant
is injurious to the grafts. But with pomegranates
and the fig and other trees of a dry nature it is far
from beneficial to put off grafting till a late season.
A pear-tree however may be grafted when actually
in blossom, and the process may be carried forward
even into May. If however cuttings of fruit trees
have to be brought from a considerable distance, it
is believed that they best preserve their sap if they
are inserted in a turnip, and it is best to store them
near a stream or a pond, packed between two hollow
