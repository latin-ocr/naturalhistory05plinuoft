BOOK XVIII. ιι. 189—Lu. 191

A plot of soil there measuring four cubits either way,
a cubit being measured not from the elbow to the
finger-tips but to the closed fist, is sold for four
denarii. But the unique point is that there are two
vintages a year, the vines bearing twice over; and
if fertility were not exhausted by multiplied pro-
duction, each crop would be killed by its own exuber-
ance, but as it is, something is being gathered all the
year round, and yet it is an absolute fact that this
I'ertility receives no assistance from human beings.
There is also a great difference of quality in the

Narbonne there is a celebrated spring with the name
of Orga, ln w hieh plants grow that are so much sought
after by oxen that they put their whole heads under
water in trying to get them3 but it is a well-known
fact that those plants though growing in water only
get their nutriment from show ers of rain. Conse-
quently it is necessary for ev erybody to know the
nature of the soil and of the water in his own district.
LII. If the land IS of the kind which we designated
‘’tender , after harvesting thc barley it will be pos-
sible to sow millet, and when that has been got in
turnip-seed, and when the millet and turnip have been
harvested barley again, or else wheat‚ as is done in
Campani ³3 and land of that nature is sufficiently
ploughed by being hoed. Another order of rotationis
for ground where there has been a crop of emmer
wheat to lie fallow during the four winter months and
to be given spring beans· ‚ but it should not lie fallow
before being sown with winter-beans. With a soil
that is too rich it is possible to employ rotation,
sowing a leguminous crop at a third sowing after the
wheat has been carried ; but a thin soil had better be
