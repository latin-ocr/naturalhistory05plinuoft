is an old one, as in that case the slip must be stouter.
A further point is that slips that are going to be
grafted must be pregnant‚ that is, swelling with bud—
formations, and in expectation of giving birth in that
year, and they must be at all events two years old,
and not thinner than the little finger. But grafts are
also inserted the other way round ‘² when the in-
tention is for them not to grow so long but to spread
out. Before all things it will be serviceable for thern
to have buds and to be glossy, as nothing shabby or
shrivelled anywhere will gratify one's hopes. The
pith of the slip grafted should be put touching the
place ὁ in the mother trce where the wood and the bark
meet, for that is more satisfactory than to place it
level with the bark outside. The process of giving a
point to the slip for grafting must not strip the pith
quite bare, but only make it visible through a narrow
aperture3 the point must slope off in an even wedge
not more than three inches long, which is most easily
achieved by dipping the slip in water when paring
it. It must not be exposed to wind while it is being
pointed. The bark must not be allowed to become
separated from the wood in either thc graft or the
trunk. The graft must be pressed right down to
where its bark begins, but it must not be forced out
of shape while it is being pressed home, nor have its
bark folded back in wrinkles. Consequently shoots
dripping with sap should not be used for grafting, no
more, I swear, than ones that are dry, because in
the former case exccss of moisture causes the bark
to slip, while in the latter owing to defective
vitality it makes no moisture and does not incorporate
with the trunk. Moreover there is a religious rule
that a graft must be inserted while the moon is
