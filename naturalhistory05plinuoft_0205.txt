and add to the destructive properties of iron itself3
we dye even the rivers and the elementa] substances
of Nature, and turn the very meansa of life into a
bane. Nor is it possible for us to suppose that
animals do not know of these things; for we have
indicated the preparations that they make to guard
against encounters with serpents and the remedies
that they have devised to employ after the battle.
Nor does any creature save man fight with poison
borrowed from another. Let us therefore confess
our guflt, we who are not content even with natural
products, inasmuch as how far more numerous
are the varieties of them made by the human
hand! thy, are not even poisons actually the
product of man's violence? Their livid tongue
flickers like the serpent’s‚ and the corruption of their
mind scorches the things it toucheS‚ maligning all
things as they do and like birds of evil omen violating
even the darkness that is their own clement and the
quiet of the night itself with their groaning, the only
sound they utter, so that like animals of evil omen
when they even cross our path they forbid us to act
or to be of service to life. And they know no other
reward for their abhorred vitality than to hate all
things. But in this matter also Nature's grandem·
is the same: how many more good 1ncn has she
engendered as her harvest! How much more fertile
is she in products that give aid and nourishment!
We too then will continue to enrich life with the value
we set on these things and the delight they give us,
leaving those bramblcs of the human race to the
consuming fire that is theirs‚ and all the more
resolutely because we achicvc greater gratification
from industiy than we do from renown. 'lhe subject
