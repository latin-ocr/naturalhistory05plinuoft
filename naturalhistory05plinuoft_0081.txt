their own incompetence. Nothing is more dis-
graceful for farmers than to do a thing and then
have to be sorry for it, so that in fact it pays much
better to err by leaving too much space between
the trees.

XX. Some trees are by nature slow growers‚ and in Pace os
particular those that only grow from seed and that {Zffl'h ⁰s
live a long time. Those on the other hand that are
short-lived, for instance the fig, pomegranate, plum,
apple, pear, myrtle and willow, grow quickly, and
nevertheless they lead the way in producing their
riches‚ for they begin to bear at three years old,
making some show even before. Among these the
pear is the slowest of all to bear, and the cypirus α and
the false cypirus bush the quickest, for this group
flowers straight away and goes on to produce its seed.

But all trees mature more quickly if the suckers are
removed and the nourishing juices brought back into
a single stem.

XXI. Nature has likewise also taught the art of re- Layeriny,
producing from layers. Brambles curving over with
their slender and also excessively long shoots plant
their ends in the earth again and §prout afresh out of
themselves, in a manner that would fill up the whole
place if resistance were not offered by cultivation, so
that it would be positively possible to imagine that
mankind was created for the service of the earth.

Thus a most evil and execrable circumstance has
nevertheless taught the use of the layer and the
quickset. Ivies also have the same property. Beside

the vine, Cato gives instructions for layering the CXXXIII-
fig, olive, pomegranate, all kinds of apples, laurels, ²“’L1’LH
plums, myrtle‚ hazel and Palestrina nuts, and the

plane.
