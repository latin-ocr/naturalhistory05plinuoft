in compensation for the rapidity with which it
grows old is endowed with the property of coming
to maturity very rapidly.

Vincs give more numerous kinds of shoots for plant- sszectinn as
ing. The first point is that none of these are used for ἷῖζῖἶῖἔζζῖἷιζθ
planting except useless growths lopped off for brush- ’
wood, whereas any branch that bore fruit last time is
pruned away. It used to be the custom to plant the
shoot with a knob of the hard wood on each side of it,
and this explains why it is still called a ‘ mallet-shoot ’ ;
but afterwards the practice began of pulling it off with
its own heel, as is done in the case of the fig? and
there is no kind of slip that grows better. A third
kind has been added that strikes even quicker, which
has the heel removed ; these slips are called ⁴ arrows '
when they are twisted before being set out, ‘ three-
bud slips ’ when they are cut off and set without
being twisted. By this method several can be ob-
tained from the same shoot. To plant from young
leafy shoots is unproductive‚ and a slip for planting
must only be taken from a shoot that has already
borne fruit. A shoot that has few knots in it is
deemed unlikely to bear, whereas a crowd of buds
is a sign of fertility. Some people say that only
shoots that have flowered should be planted. lt
does not pay so well to plant arrow—slips‚ because
anything that is twisted easily gets broken in being
moved. Shoots chosen for planting should be not
less than a foot long, with five or six knots3 that.
length of shoot will not possibly have less than three
buds. It pays best to plant them 011 the Same day
as they are cut off, or if a considerable postponement
cannot be avoided, to keep them well protected‚ as
we have instructcd, or at all events to be carefumni-
