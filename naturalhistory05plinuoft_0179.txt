the hard oak and the common oak. If only a narrow

band of bark is removed, it causes no harm, as with

the trees above mentioned, although with weakerwffl-
trees at all events and in a thin soil to remove the

bark even from only one part kills the tree. A
similar effect is also produced by lopping the top of a
spruce, prickly cedar or cypress, for to remove the top

or to scorch it with fire is fatal to these trees; and

the effect of being gnawn by animals is also similar.
Indeed, according to Varro, as we have stated, an {Ut-204,
olive goes barren if merely licked by a she-goat. XV'34'
Certain trees die of this injury‚ but some only de-
teriorate‚ for instance almonds, the fruit of which is
changed from sweet to bitter, but others are actually
improved, for instance the pear called the Phocian

pear in Chios. For we have mentioned trees that XIII-36-
are actually benefited by having the top lopped off. XV11.201.
Most trees die also when the trunk is split, excepting

the vine, apple‚ fig and pomegranates, and some

merely from a wound, though the pine and all the
resinous trees despise this injury. For a trce to die

when its roots are cut off is not at all surprising3

most trees die even when deprived not of all their

roots but of the largest ones or those among them

that are essential to life.

Trees kill one another by their shade or the thick- Damaqe by

nutriment; they are also killed by ivy binding them vlam&-
round, and mistletoe does them no good, and cytisus
kills them, and they are killed by the plant called
halimon by the Greeks. The nature of some plants
though not actually deadly is injurious owing to its
blend of scents or of juice—for instance the radish
and the laurel are harmful to the vine; for the vine
