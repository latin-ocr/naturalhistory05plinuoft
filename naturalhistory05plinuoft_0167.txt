the limbs, resulting in debility of the various parts
—maladies sharing even their names with those of
mankind: we certainly speak of trees being muti-
lated and having the eyes of their buds burnt out
and many misfortunes of a kind resembling our own.
Accordingly they suffer both from hunger and from
indigestion‚ maladies due to the amount of moisture
in them, and some even from obesity‚ for instance all
which produce resin owing to excessive fatness are
converted into torch-wood, and when the roots also
have begun to get fat, die like animals from excessive
adipose deposit3 and sometimes also they die of
epidemics prevailing in certain classes of tree, just as
among mankind diseases sometimes attack the slaves
and sometimes the urban or the rural lower classes.
particular trees are attacked by worm in a greater
or smaller degree, but nearly all are liable, and birds
detect worm-eaten wood by the hollow sound when
they tap the bark. Nowadays indeed even this has
begun to be classed as a luxury, and specially lnge
