however there is also a difference arising from the
seed, since some produce an inferior seed and some
an extremely small one; but these defects only apply
to the wrinkled-leaf variety. Our own people have
made other classes-the Monte Compatri radish‚
named from its locality, a long and semi—transparent
radish‚ and another shaped like a turnip which they call
