BOOK XVIII. xut. 163-166

XLVI. This then is the opinion of Cato ⁰ : ‘ In thick Caroxv advice
and fertile land wheat should be sown; but ifthc same {szsanous
land is liable to sog, turnip, radishes, common and
Italian millets. In cold or damp land sowing should be
done earlier, but in warin land later. In a ruddle-soil
or in dark or sandy soil, isit is not damp, sow lupinc ; in
chalk and red earth and rather damp land, emmer
wheat; in dry land that is free from grass and not
overshaded‚ wheat ; beans in strong soil, but vetch in
the least damp and weedy soil: common and other
bare wheats in an open and elevated locality that gcts
the warmth of the sun as long as possible3 lentils in
poor and ruddle-soil that is free from grass ; barley in
fallow land and also in land that can produce a second
crop; three-month wheat where the land could not
ripen an ordinary crop and which is rich enough to
produce a second crop.’

The following also is acute advice ε ⁶ “ In a rather ναν-ναῖε
thin soil crops should be sown that do not need much ·
moisture, for instance trec-medick‚ and such of the
leguminous plants, except chick-pea‚ as are gathered
by being pulled up out of the ground and not by being
cut—which is the reason why they arc called “ crops '’,
because that is how they are “ cropped ’'——‚ but in rich
land the plants that need greater nutriment, such
as greens‚ wheat, common wheat, flax. Under this
method consequently thin soil will be assigned to
barley, as its root demands less nourishment, while
more easily worked and denser earth will be allotted to
wheat. In a rather damp place emmer will be sown in
preference to other wheat, but in soil of medium quality
this and also barley. Hillsides produce a stronger
wheat but a smaller crop of it. Emmer and common
wheat can do with both chalky and marshy soil.’
