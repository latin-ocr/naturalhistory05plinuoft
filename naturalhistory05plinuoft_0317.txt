place requires this, for these to draw off the water
into the ditches.

After the cross-ploughing has been done there a o ι

rake where circumstances require it, and, where local
custom allows‚ this second breaking is also repeated
after the seed has been sown, by means of a harrow-
framework or with a board attached to the plough
covering up the seeds—this process is called ridging;
if they are not covered, this is ‘ unridging ’—the

however it is a labour-saving plan involving no loss to
dispenso with preliminary breaking before sowing.
