from the middle, the Greek name for which is
‘ middles ', is most highly esteemed. The second
best hemp comes from Mylasa. As regards height,
the hemp of Rosea in the Sabine territory grows as
tall as a fruit-trec. The two kinds of fennel-giant
have been mentioned above among exotic shrubs.
In Italy its seed is an article of diet3 in fact it is
stoi-ed in pots and lasts for as much as a year. Two
different parts of it are used as vegetables‚ the
stalks and the braiiches. This fennel is called in
Greek clump-fennel, and thc parts that are stored,
clumps.

LVII. Garden vegetables are also liable to disease‚
like the rest of the plants on earth. For instance
basil degenerates with old age into wild-thyme and
sisymbrium into mint, and old cabbage seed produces
turnip, and so on. Also cummin is killed by broom-
rape unless it is thoroughly cleaned: this is a plant
with a single stalk anda root resembling a bulb, and it
only grows in a thin soil. Another disease peculiar to
cummin is scab. Also basil turns pale at the rising
of the Dog-Star. All plants indeed turn yellow when
a woman comes near them at her monthly period.
Also various insects breed on garden plants—
springtails in navews, caterpillars and maggots in
radish, and also on lettuces and cabbage, both of
which are more infested by slugs and snails than
radish; and the leek has special insects of its
own, which are easily caught by throwing dung
on the plants, as they burrow into it. According
to Sabinus Tiro in his book On Gardening, which
he dedicated to Maecenas, it is also bad for rue,
savory, mint or basil to come in contact with
iron.
