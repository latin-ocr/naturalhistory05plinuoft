rising marks the beginning of summer and their set-
ting that of winter, embracing in the six months·
space between them the harvest and vintage and
ripening of all vegetation. And the sky also con-
tains the constellation called the Milky Way, which
is also easily recognized“ by observing two others,
the Eagle in the northern region and in the southern
the Little Dog, which we have mentioned in its
proper place. T he Milky W'ay itself passes through §268-
the Archer and the 'l'wins, cutting the equinoctial
orbit twice at the sun’s centre-point‚ the intersections
being marked by the Eagle on one side and the Little
Dog on the other. Consequently the influences of
each of these constellations reach to all cultivated
lands, inasmuch as these are the only points at which
the centres of the sun and earth correspond. Con-
sequently if on the datesb of these constellations
the atmosphere is clear and mild and transmits this
genial milky juice to the lands of the earth, the
crops grow luxuriantly3 but if the moon scatters a
dewy cold after the manner previously described,§2⁷7.
the admixture of bitterness, like sourness in milk,
kills off the infant offspring. The measure of this
injury in various countries is that occasioned in each
part of earth¹s convex surfaee by the combination of
each of these two causes, and so it is not per-
ceived simultaneously in the whole of the world, as
daybreak is not either. We have saidc that the
Eagle rises in Italy on December 20, and Nature's
system does not permit any of the crops sown to
be of certain promise before that day; but if the
moon happens then to be in conjunction, all the
winter and early spring produce is bound to suffer
damage.
