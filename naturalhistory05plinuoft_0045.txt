name of leucargillum to a white clay that they use on
the land at Megara, but only where the soil is damp
and chilly. Thoe other substance brings wealth to
the provinces of Gaul and Britain, and may suitably
receive a careful description.

There had previously been two kinds of marl, but
recently with the progress of discov eries a larger
number have begun to be w orked: there' 1s white marl,
red marl, dov-e coloured marl, argillaceous marl, tufa
marl and sand marl. It has a two· fold consistency,
rough or greasy‚ each of which can be detecte-d by its
feel in the hand. Its use is correspondingly double,
to seed cereals only or to seed pasture- -land as well.
Tufa marl nourishes grain, and white marl, 1f itis found
where springs rise, has unlimited fertilizing properties,
but it is rough to handle, and isit is scattered in ex-
cessive quantities it scorches up the soil. The next
kind is the red marl, which is known as αεατιηηφηιινέζα,α
consisting of stone mingled with a thin, sandy carth.
The stone is crushed on the land itself‚ and in the
earliest years of its employment the fragments make
the cornstalks difficult to cut; however, as it is ex-
tremely light it can be carried for only half of the
cost charged for the other varictics. It is scattered
on the land thinly 3 it is thought to contain a mixture
of salt. With both of these kinds a single scattcr·

pasture.

Of the marls that are greasy to the touch the chief
one is the white. It has several varieties‚ the most

pungent being the one mentioned above. Another ἐξ ‹aa—⁴4.
