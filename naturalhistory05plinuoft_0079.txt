BOOK XVII. xvm. 91-x1x. §4

Even this department of knowledge is not to be
despised‚ nor put in the last class, inasmuch as to each
kind of plant shade is either a nurse or else a step-
mother—at all events for the shadow ofa walnut tree
or a stone pine or a spruce or a silver fir to touch any
plant whatever is undoubtedly poison.

XIX. The question of raindrops falling from trees
can be settled briefly. With all the trees which are
so shielded by the spread of their foliage that the rain—
water does not flow down over the tree itself the drip
does cruel injury. Consequently in this enquiry it
will make a great deal of difference over what space
the soil in which we are going to plant causes the
various trees to grow. In the first place, hillsides in
themselves require smaller intervals between the
trees. In places exposed to the wind, it pays to plant
trees closer together, but nevertheless to give the olive
very wide spaeing‚ Cato's opiniona for Italy being that
olives should be planted 25 or at most 30 feet apart;
but this varies with the nature of the sites. The olive
is the largest of all the trees in Andalusia3 in Africa,
however, so it is stated—the guarantee for this state-
ment will rest with the authorities who make it—
there are a number of trees called ‘ thousand-
pounders ⁹, from the weight of oil that they produce
in a year’s crop. Consequently Mago has prescribed a
space of 75 feet all round, or in thiu, hard soil exposed
to the wind, 45 feet at least. Andalusia however
reaps most abundant erops of corn grown between
the olives. It will be agreed that it shows shame-
ful ignorance to thin full-grown trees more than a
proper amount and hasten them into old age, or
to cut them down altogether, by doing which
the persons who planted them frequently manifest
