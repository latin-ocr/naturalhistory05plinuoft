nurseries‚ as from the roots of many trees there shoots nurseries,
up a teeming cluster of progeny, and the mother tree
bears offspring destined to be killed by herself, inas-
much as her shadow stifles the disorderly throng——as
in the case of laurels, pomegranateS, planes, cherries
and plums· , although with a few trees in this class, for
instance elms and palms‚ the branches spare the young

ground. All of these it is customaiy not to put in
their own ground at once, but first to give them to a
foster-mother and let them grow up in seed-plots‚

trees. whether it be the case that, like human beings‚
trees also have a nature that is greedy for novelty
