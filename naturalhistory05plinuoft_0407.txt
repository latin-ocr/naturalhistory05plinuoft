it, as well as felling timber and the other operations
which we have specified in their proper places. Nor
is the observation of the moon specially easy, and we
have already spoken of it in Volume ΙΙ; 1)111 10 give
what even countrymen may be able to understand:
whenever the moon is seen at sunset and in the
earlier hours of the night, 5116 will be waxing and
will appear to be cut in half, but when 5116 11565
at sunset opposite the 51111, 50 that sun and moon
are visible at the same time, then it will be full
moon. When she rises with the sunrise and withholds
her light in the earlier 1101115 of the night and prolongs
it into daytime‚ she will be waning and will again
show only half3 but when she has ceased to be
visible she is in conjunction, the period designated
⁸ between moons ’. During the conjunc-tion she will
be above the horizon as long as the sun is and during
the whole of the first day, on the second day ten and
a quarter twelfths of an hour of the night,‘² and
then on the third day and 011 to the l5th with the
same fractions of an hour added in progression.
On the 15111 day 5116 will be above 1116 horizon all
night and also below it all day. On the 16111 she will
remain below the horizon 1611 and a quarter twelfths
of the first hour of the night, and she will go on adding
the same fraction of an hour every day in succession
until the period of conjunction, and will add from the
day-time to the last parts of the night above the
horizon as much as she subtracts from its first parts
when below the earth. She will complete thirty
revolutions in alternate months but subtract one from
that number every alternate month. This will be
the theory of the course of the moon; that of the
winds is somewhat more intricate.
