flower is passed down into a tube they grow to a
remarkable length. Curious to say, just recently a
new form of cucumber has been produced in Cam-
pania, shaped like a quince. I am told that first one
grew in this shape by accident, and that later a
v ariety w as established grown from seed obtained from
this one: it is called apple- pumpkin. Cucumbers of
this kind do not hang from the plant but grow of a
round shape lying on the ground ; they have a golden
colour. A remarkable thing about them, beside their
shape‚ colour and smell, is that when they have
ripened, although they are not hanging down they at
once separate from the stalk. Columella gives a plan xl.
of his own for getting a supply of cucumbers all the
year round—to transplant the largest blackberry bush
available to a warm, sunny place, and about the spring
equinox to cut it back, leaving a stump two inehes
long; and then to insert a cucumber seed 111 the pith of
the bramble and bank up fine earth and manure round
the roots, so that they may withstand the cold. The
Greeks have produced three kinds of cucumbers,the
Spartan, the Scytalic and the Boeotian ; of these it is
said that only the Spartan variety is fond of water.
Some peoplc tell us to steep cucumber seed in the
plant called culioe pounded up before sowing it, which
will produce a cucumber having no seed.
