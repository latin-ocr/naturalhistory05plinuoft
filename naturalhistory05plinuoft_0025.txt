BOOK XVII. 11. 12—15

Cold weather only does damage when it comcs with ⁹
northerly winds, or not at the proper seasons ; indeed
for a north-east wind to prevail in winter is most bene-
ficial for all erops. But there is an obvious reason for
desiring rain in that season, because it is natural for
the trees when exhausted by bearing fruit and also by
the loss of their leaves to be famishcd with hunger,
and rain is a food for them. Consequently experience
inspires the belief that a mild winter, causing the trees
the moment they have finished bearing to conceive,
that is to bud, again, this being followed by another
exhausting period of blossoming, is an extremely
detrimental thing. Indeed if several years in suc-
cession should take this course, even the trees them-
selves may die, since no onc can doubt the punishment
they suffer from putting forth their strength when in
a hungry condition; consequently the poet who told
us to pray for finer winters ‘¹ was not framing a litany
for the benefit of trees. Nor yet is wet weather over
midsummer good for vines. It has indeed been said‚‘² Trees bene-
thanks to the fcrtility ofa vivid imagination,c that dust Med (Ψ snow.
in winter makes more abundant harvests3 but, quite
apart from this, it is the prayer of trees and erops in
common that snow may lie a long time. The reason
is not only because snow shuts in and imprisons the
earth’s breath when it is disappearing by evaporation,
and drives it back into the roots of the vegetation to
make strength, but because it also affords a gradual
supply of moisture, and this moreover of a pure and
extremely light quality, owing to the fact that rime is
the foam of the waters of heaven. Consequently the
moisture from snow, not inundating and drenching
everything all at once, but shedding drops as from a
breast in proportion to the thirst felt, noui-ishes all
