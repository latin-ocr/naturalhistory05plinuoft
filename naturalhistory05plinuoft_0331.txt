LVI. There follows the question postponed to this
place, a question that needs very careful consideration
—that of the proper date for sowing the crops; it is
in a large degree connected with astronomy, and
consequently we will begin by setting out the views
of all authors' 1n regard to it. Hesiod, the leader of
mankind in imparting agricultural instruction, gaxe
only one date for sowing, to begin at the setting os
the Pleiads; for he wrote in the Greek country of
Boeotia where, as we have said, that is the eustom
for sowing. It is agreed among the most eareful
observers that, as in the propagation of birds and
animals, so with the earth, there exist certain impulses
leading to conceptiom and the Greeks define this as
the period when the earth is warm and moist. Virgil
prescribes sowing bare and emmer wheats after
the setting of the Pleiads, barley between the
autumnal equinox and mid-winter, but vetch and cala-
vances and lentils at the setting of Boote33 with the
consequence that it is important to ascertain the exact
dates of the rising and setting of these and other
stars. There are some who advise sowing before the
Setting of the Pleiads‚ at all events in dry land and
in the provinces with a warm climate, because
the seed keeps safely, there being no damp to
make them rot, and within a day after the next fall
of rain they break out3 while others recommend
sowing immediately after the setting of the Pleiads,
because about a week later rains follow; and some
advise beginning to sow at the autumnal equinox
in cold places, but later in warm districts, so that
the crops may not be too far forward before winter.
