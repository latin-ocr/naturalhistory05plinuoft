then to pour the liquid on them gradually. In thc
case of an olive it should be used more copiously‚
straw having first been put round the stem, and the
same with a fig3 with a fig, especially in spring⁷ earth
should be heaped up round the roots‚ and this will
ensure that the unripe fruit will not fall off and the tree
will bear a larger crop and will not develop roughness
of the bark. In a similar manner to prevent a vine
from breeding leaf-rolling caterpillar he advises boiling
down two gallons of lees of olive-011 to the thick-
ness of honey, and boiling it again mixed with a third
part of bitumen and a fourth part of sulphur, this
second boiling being done in the open air, because
the mixture may catch fire indoors3 and he says
this preparation is to be smeared round the bases
and under the arms of the vines, and that will prevent
caterpillar. Some growcrs are content with sub-

sharpened and then use them for pruning, or smear
them with bear's blood after pruning. Ants also arc

the trunks with a mixture of red earth and tar, and
also people get the ants to collect in one place by
hanging up a fish close by, or thr-y smear the roots
