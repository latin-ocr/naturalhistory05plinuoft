The rest depends on the weather: dry weather is
most favourable for grasts, because a remedy for its
ill effects is to place earthenware pots of ashes on
the stock and let a small amount of water filter
through the ashes; but grafting by inoculation likes
a light fall of dew.

thought to have sprung ftom grafting by inoculation‚ Was‘i'W·
but it is most suited to a thick bark, such as that of
fig-trees. The procedure is to prune all the branehes
so that they may not attract the sap, and then, at
the most flourishing part of the tree and where it
displays exceptional luxuriance, to remove a scut-
cheon, without allowing the knife to penetrate below
the bark3 and then to take a piece of bark of equal
size from another tree‚ together with a protuberant
bud, and press it into the place, fitting the join so
closely that there is no room for a sear to form and a
single substance is produced straight away, imper-
vious to damp and to air—though all the same it is
better to protect the splice by plastering it with mud
and tying it with a bandage. People in favour of
modern fashions make out that this kind of grafting
was only recently invented, but it is found already
in the old Greek writers and in Cato, who prescribed XLn.
this method of grafting for the olive and the fig, in
conformity with his invariable precision actually defin-
ing the proper measurement: he says that a piece
of bark four inches long and three wide should be
cut out with a knife‚ and so fitted to its place and
smeared with that pounded mixture of his described
above, in the same way as in grafting an apple. In s 111-
the case of vines some people have combined with
this kind of grafting the fissure method, removing a
