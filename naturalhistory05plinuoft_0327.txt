if the land is not 111 inui ed it gets chilled, and if it is
gix en too much manure it becomes burnt up; and it
pa3s better to do the manuring frequently than to
manure to excess. It stands to reason that the
w·1rmei·the soil is the less manure it should be giv en.

scedis inferior, thr( e- 3 ear old very poor, and bey onds
that it is barren3 in fact all thing rs have a limitrdso
period of fertility. The seed that falls to the bottom
on the threshing—floor should be kept for sowing, as
it is the best because the hem-iest, and there is no
other more efficient way of distinguishing it. An
ear having its seeds separated by gaps will be dis-
carded. The best grain is that which is reddish in
colour and which when crushed by the teeth shows
the same colour inside, and one that lias more white
inside is infierior. It is a well-known fact that some
lands take more seed and others less, and this sup-
plies farmers with a binding and primary augury:
when the earth receives the seed more greedily, it
is believed to be hungry and to devour the seed.
The plan is for sowing to be done more quickly in
danip places, to prevent the seed from being rotted
by moisture, but later in dry places, so that the
rainfalls may come afterwards to prevent the seed
from lying for a long time without germinating and
so withering away3 and similarly when sowing is
hurried on it pays to scatter the seed thick-ly, because
it conceives slowly‚ but when sowing is late, to
scatter it thin, because excessive closeness kills it.
Also there is a certain seience in seattering the seed
evenly3 at all events the hand must keep in time
with the pace of walking, and always go with the
right foot. Also it coines about by some not obvious
