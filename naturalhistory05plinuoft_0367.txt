involves very little outlay; it requires the following
remarks to be made about it. Land should be left
in grass where the soil is rich or damp or watered by
streams, and the meadows should be watered by the
rainfall or by a public aqueduct. If there are weeds,
the best plan is to plough up the land and then
harrow and hoe it, and sprinkle it with seed fallen
out of the hay from haylofts and from mangers be-
fore the weeds are harrowed; and it is best not to
irrigate the land in the first year, nor to use it for
grazing before the second cutting of the hay, so
that the grass may not be torn up by the roots or
trodden down and weakened. Meadows go off with
age, and need to be revived by sowing in them a crop
of beans or turnip or millet, and afterwards in the
follow 1ng year corn, and ln the third year they should
again be left fallow; and moreov·e1 ev·e1y time they
are cut they should be gone over with the sickle, for
the purpose of cutting all the growth that the mowers
have passed over; for it is very detrimental indeed
for any weeds to spring up that will scatter seeds.
The best crop in meadow land is trefoil, the next best
grass3 money-wort is the worst, and it also bears a
terrible pod ; horse-hair,‹1 named from its resemblance
to horses’ hair, is also a hateful weed. The time for
mowing is when the stalk has begun to shed its
blossom and to grow strong3 the grass must be cut
before it begins to dry up ‘Do not mow your hay
too lates says Cato3 ‘cut it before the seul is ripe.

Some farmers irrigate the fields th( day before
mowing, but where there is no means of doing this
it is better to mow when there are heavy falls of dew
at night. Some parts of Italy mow after harvest.
Mowing was also a more expensive operation in
