scraped ost when they are served as food3 and
although it is healthy and agreeable in a v ariety of
ways. it is nevertheless one of the rinds that cannot
be digested by the human stomach‚ but sw ell up. The
seeds that were nearest the neck of the plant produce
long gourds, and so do those next to the bottom,
though the gourds grown from them are not compar-
able with those mentioned above3 the secds in the
middle grow into round gourds‚ and those at the sides
into thick and shorter ones. The seeds are dricd in the
shade‚ and when they are wanted for sowing they are
steeped in water. The longer and thinner gourds
are, the more agreeable they are for food, and
consequently those which have been left to grow
hanging are more wholesome; and this kind contain
fewest seeds, the hardness of which limits their
agreeableness as an article of diet. Gourds kept for
seed are not usually cut before winter3 after cutting
they are dried in smoke for storing seeds of garden
plants-the farm’s stock in store. A plan has been
invented by which they are preserved for food also—-
and the same in the case ofcucumbers—to last almost
until the next crops are available. This method em-
ploys brine ; but it is reported that. gourds can also be
kept green in a treneh dug in a shady place and floored
with sand and covered over with dry hay and theu
with earth. There are also wild varieties of both
cucumbers and gout-ds, as is the case with almost all
garden plants3 but these also only possess medicinal
propertieS‚ and therefore they will be deferred to the xx 8: 13.
