the ground being ploughed. It requires most of all
a gravelly and dry and even sandy soil, and in any
case needs no cultivation. It has such a love for the
earth that when it falls on soil however much over-
grown with briars it penetrates among leaves and
brambles and gets through with its root to the ground.
We have stated that fields and vineyards are enriehed
by 3 crop of lupines; and thus it has so little need
for manure that it serves instead of manure of the
best quality, and there is no other erop that costs no
expenditure at all—seeing that it does not require

it sows itself direetly from the crop‚‘² and does not even
