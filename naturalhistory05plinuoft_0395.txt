richness of the juioe, which may be enough to supply
moisture, as with sesame, or in bitter flavour‚‘¹ as with
lupine and chickling vetch. It is specially in wheat
that grubs breed, because its density makes it get
hot and the grain becomes covered with thick bran.
Barley chaffis thinner, and also that of the leguminous
plants is scanty, and consequently these do not breed
grubs. A bean is covered with thicker coats, and
this makes it ferment. Some people sprinkle the
wheat itself with dregs of olive oil to make it keep
better, eight gallons to a thousand pecks; others
use chalk from Chalcis or Caria for this purpose, or
even wormwood. There is also an earth found at
Olynthus and at Cerinthus in Euboea which prevents
grain from rotting; also if stored in the ear corn
hardly ever suffers injury. The most paying method
however of keeping grain is in holes, called siri,
as is done in Cappadocia and Thrace, and in Spain
and Africa3 and before all things care is taken to
make them in dry soil and then to floor them with
chaff; moreover the corn is stored in this way in the
ear. If no air is allowed to penetrate, it is certain
that no pests will breed in the grain. Varro states
that wheat so stored lasts fifty years, but millet a
hundred, and that beans and leguminous grain, if
put away in oil jars m‘th a covering of ashes, keep a
long time. He also records that beans stored in a
cavern in Ambracia lasted from the period of King
Pyrrhus to Pompey the Great’s war with the pirates‚b
a period of about 220 years. Chick·pea is the only
grain which does not breed any grubs when kept in
barns. Some people pile leguminous seed in heaps
on to jars containing vinegar, placed on a bed of ashes
and coated with pitch‚ believing that this prevents
