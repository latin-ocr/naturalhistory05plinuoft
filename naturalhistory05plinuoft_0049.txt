as even with dung it does not promote fertility in
the first year. It also makes a difference what sort of
soil the marl is required for, as the dry kind is better
for a damp soil and the greasy kind for a dry soil,
while either sort suits land of medium quality, either
chalk-marl or dove-marl.

V. Farmers north of the Po are so fond of employ-

stable dung, which is the lightest kind, in order to
get the ash. Nevertheless they do not use both
kinds of manure indifferently in the same field, and
do not use ashes in plantations of shrubs, nor for
some kinds of crops, as we shall explain later. Some
are of the opinion that dust helps the growth of grapeS‚
and they sprinkle it on the fruit when it is forming and
scatter it on the roots of the vines and the trees.“
It is certainly the case that in the Province of Nar-
bonne a wind from west-north-west ripens vintage
gmpes, and in that district dust contributes more
than sunshine.

VI. There are several varieties of dung, and its
actual employment dates a long way back3 as far
back as Ηοῐηεὲν,ὸ an aged king in the poem is found
thus enriching his land with his own hands. T he
invention of this procedure is traditionally ascribed to
King Augeas in Greece, and its introduction in Italy
to Hercules, though Italy has immortalized Stercutus ⁶
son of Faunus on account of this invention. Marcus
Varrod gives the first rank to thrushes' droppings
from aviaries, which he also extols for fodder of cattle
and swine, declaring that no other fodder fattens thern
more quickly. If our ancestors had such large
aviaries that they supplied manure for the fields, it is
