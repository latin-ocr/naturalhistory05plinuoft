is that of one in which the vine is left to stand by
itself without a stay, for this is only done when
there is a shortage of props. A vineyard with the
single cross-bar is arranged in a straight row which
is called a canterin83 this is better for wine, 35 the
vine so grown does not overshadow itself and 15
ripened by constant sunshine, and 15 more exposed
to currents of air and so gets rid of dew more quickly,
and also is easier for trimming and for han-owing the
soil and all operations3 and above all it shcds its
blossoms in a more beneficial manner. The cros-s-
bar is made of a stake or a reed, or else of 3 rope of
hair or hemp, as in Spain and at Brindisi. More wine
is produced by a rectangle-frame vineyard (the 1131110
15 taken from the rectangular openings in the roofs
ofthe courts of houses) ‘¹3 this is divided into compart-
ments of four by the same number of cross-bars.
The method of growing vines with this frame will
be described, and the same account will hold good
in the case of every sort of frame, the only differcnce
being that in this 0350 it is more complicated.
There are in fact three ways of planting a vinc3
the best is to use ground that has been (lug over, the
next best to plant in a furrow. and the last to plant
in a hole. The method of digging over 1135 been
described; for a furrow a spade's breadth is enough,
and for 110105 the breadth of 3 yard each way. In
each method the depth must be a yard, and con-
sequently the vine transplantcd must be not less
than a yard long, even so allowing two buds to be
above the surface. It is essential to softcn the earth
by making very small furrows at the bottoni of the
hole and to mix dung with it. Sloping ground
requires deepcr holes, with their cdgcs on the lower
