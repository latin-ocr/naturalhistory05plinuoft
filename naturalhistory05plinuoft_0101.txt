difference between the two varieties is this: the
former is more prolific but the latter, the Tereus
chestnut, of better quality.

XXVII. It. is mere accident that by its own ingen-
uity has devised the remaining kinds of reproduction ;
it taught us to break off branches from trees and
plant them because stakes driven into the earth had
taken root. This method is used to grow many
trees, especially the fig, which can be grown in all
the other ways except from a cutting3 the best plan
indeed is to take a comparatively large branch and
point it at the end like a stake and drive it deep into
the earth, leaving a small head above ground and
covering up even this with sand. Pomegranates
also are grown from a branch, the passage into the
hole having first been widened with stakes3 and so
also the myrtle3 in all of these a branch is used that
is three feet long and not so thick as a man's arm,
and the bark is carefully preserved and the trunk⁰
sharpened to a point at the end.

XXVIII. The myrtle is grown from cuttings as
well as in other ways, and that is the only way used
for the mulberry, because superstitious sear of light-
ning forbids its being grafted on an elm. Conse-
quently we must now speak about the planting of
cuttings. In this care must be taken above all that
the cuttings are made from trees that bear well,
that they are not bent in shape nor scabbed or
forked, that they are thick enough to fill the hand
and not less than a foot long, that they are planted
without injury to the bark and always with the cut
end and the part that was nearest the root downward,
and during the process of budding the plant is kept
heaped over with earth until it attains strength.
