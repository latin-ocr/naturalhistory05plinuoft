It is cut when it is beginning to flower and every
time it flowers again: this happens six times, or at
the least four times, in a year. It must be prevented
from running to seed, because till it 15 three years old
it is more useful as fodder. It must be hoed in spring-
time and rid of all other plants, and till the third year
shaved down 10 1116 earth with weeding-hoes: this
makes the rest of the plants die without damaging the
lucerne itself, because of the. depth of its roots. If
weeds get the upper hand, the sole remedy is in the
plough, by repeatedly turning the soil till all the other
roots die. It must not be fed to cattle to the point
of repletion, lest it should be necessary to let blood.
Also it is more useful when green, as it dries into a
woody state and finally thius out into a useless dust.

About tree-medick, which itself also is given a very
high rank among fodder, we have spoken sufficiently
among the shrubs. And now we have to complete xm. 130.
our account of the nature of all the cereals, in one
part of which we must also speak about diseases.

degeneration in question is principally due to damp-
ness of soil and climate, but a subsidiary cause is
contained in weakness of the seed, if it is held back
too long in the ground before it shoots out. There
is also the same explanation if it was rotten when it
was sown. But it is recognizable the moment it
breaks out of the ground, which shows that the

disease arising in close connection with oats, when
