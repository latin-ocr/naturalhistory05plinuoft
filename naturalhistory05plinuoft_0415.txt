should pasture their flocks exposed to this wind, so
that it may thus fceundate the sire when coupling.
The African wind, the Greek name for which is Libs‚
will blow from the south-west, directly opposite to
Aquilo; when animals after coupling turn towards
this quarter, you may be sure that they have got
females.

The third⁰ line from the north, which we have
drawn transversely to the shadow and have called the
decuman, will have the sunrise at the equinoxcs and
the Subsolanus wind, called by the Greeks AphelioteS.
This is the proper aspect for farm-houses and vinc-
yards in healthy localities. This wind itself brings
gentle rains; still Favonius, the wind in the opposite
quarter, blowing from the equinoctial sunset‚ the
Greek name for which is ZephyruS, is gentler and
drier. This is the direction in which Cato recom-
mended that olive-yards should face3 this wind
inaugurates the spring, and opens up the land, having
a healthy touch of cold, and it will give the right
time for pruning vines, tending crops, planting trees,
grafting fruit-trees and treating olives; and its
breeze will have a nutritive effect. The fourth line
from the north, lying nearest the south on the eastern
side, will have the sunrise at midwintcr and the wind
Volturnus, the Greek name for which is Eurus, which
itself also is rather dry and warm3 this is the proper
aspect for beehives and for vineyards in Italy, and the
provinces of Gaul. Directly opposite to Volturnus
will blow Corus, from the point of sunset at mid-
summer, on the sunset side of north, its Greek name
being Argestes3 it also is one of the coldest winds,
as are all those blowing from the north ; it also brings
hailstorms, and is quite as much to be avoided as the
