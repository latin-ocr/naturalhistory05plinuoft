BOOK XVIII. xxx. 120—xxxl. 123

instead of stable manure to fertilize the ground it is
grown in; consequently in the districts of Macedon
and Thessaly when it begins to blossom the farmers
plough up the fields. It also grows wild in most
places, for example the islands of the North Sea, for
which our name is consequently the Bean Islands,‘¹
and it also grows wild all over Mauretania, though
this bean is very hard and incapable of being cooked.

It ὁ also grows in Egypt, where it has a thorny stalk quptian
which makes the crocodilos keep away from it for ‘² ·
fear of injuring their eyes. The stalk is two yards
long at most and the thickness of a finger: if it had
knots in it, it'would be like a soft reed; it has a head
like a poppy, is rose-coloured, and bears not more
than thirty beans on each stalk; the leaves are
large; the actual fruit is bitter even in smell‚ but
the root is a very popular article of diet with the
nath-es, and is eaten raw and cooked in every sort of
way ; it resembles the roots of reeds. The Egyptian
heau also grows in Syria and Cilicia, and at the
Lake of Torone in Chalcidice.

XXXI. Vegetables sown in autumn or spring are Lernils and
the lentil and in Greece the pea. The lentil likes pm·
a thin soil better than a rich one, and in any case a
dry climate. Egypt has two kinds of lentil, one
rounder and blacker, the other the normal shape,
which has given the name of lenticle applied to small
flasks. I find it stated in writers that a lentil diet
conduces to an equable temper. Peas must be sown
in sunny placeS‚ as they stand cold very badly; con-
sequently in Italy and in severer cliinates they are
only sown in spring, in yielding soil that has been
well loosened.
