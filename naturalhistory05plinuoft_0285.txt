of the various kinds of birds as well, and the more so

comes, and 11 serves as a precaution against scarcity
of food. It ranks third after wine and 00111 among
the products of the country north of the Po. It is
not particular in its choice of soil, growing where
almost nothing else can be grown. It actually
