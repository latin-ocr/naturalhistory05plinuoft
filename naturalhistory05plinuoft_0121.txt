tree, stretches forward filling up the length in front
of it, so long as the knots are open, with a tube that
allows a passage ; but when they have become solidi-
fied and prevent passage, the pith is thrown back
and bursts out at its lowest part close to the previous
knot with a series of alternate. lateral forks, as has
been stated in the case of the recd and of the giant
fennel3 with these the swelling from the bottom
knot can be observed on the right and that at the
next one on the left, and so on alternately. In the
case of a vine, when this swelling makes a knob at
the knot it is called a ‘gem ’, but before it makes a
knob, in the hollow part it is called an ‘eye’ and
at the actual top a ‘germ ’. This is the way in
which the main shoots, side-slioots‚ grapes, leaves
and tendrils are formed; and it is a remarkable fact
that those growing on the right-hand side are the
stronger.

Consequently when these slips are planted it is
necessary to cut the knots in them across the middle,
without letting the pith run out. And in the case
of a fig nine-inch slips are planted in holes made in
the ground with pegs, in such a way as to have the
parts that were nearest to the tree sunk into the
earth and two eyes projecting above the surface
(the term ‘ eyes ’ in slips of trees properly denotes
the points from which they send out shoots). It is
because of this that even when bcdded out the slips
occasionally produce in the same year the. fruit they
were going to bear on the trec if they have been
planted at the proper time when pregnant, and give
birth in their other position to the progcny they
had begun to conceive. Fig-trces struck in this· way
arc easily transplanted two years later, as this trec
