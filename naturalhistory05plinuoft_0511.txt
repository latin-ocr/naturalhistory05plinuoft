about as 3 protection against the ravages of birds
that eat up the seeds, and the birds that swallow
it at once become stupefied, and if you wait a little,
go completely unconscious and can be caught by
hand. There is also a wild kind called bear's garlic‚
with a similar smell, which has a very small head and

large leaves.

Dill comes up in 3 days, lettuce 4, radish 9, cucumber
5, gourd even 6-cucumber is earlier—, cress band
mustard 4, summer beet 5, winter beet 9, orage 7,
onions 18 or 19, long onion 9 or 11 ; coriander is more
obstinate, and indeed cunilae and wild marjoram do
not come up before 30 days, but the most difficult
of all is parsley, for it comes up in 39 days at the
quickest, and in the majority of cases in 49 days.
Something also depends on the age of the seed, as
fresh seed comes up more quickly in the case of
leek, long onion, cucumber and gourd, but parsley,
beet, cress, cunila, wild marjoram and coriander
grow more quickly from old seed. There is a
curious thing about beet seed that the whole of
it does not germinate in the same year but some
only in the year following, and some even two
years later; and consequently a quantity of seed
only produces a moderate crop. Some plants
only produce seed in the same year as they are
planted, but some more often, for instance parsley,
leek and long onion, as these when once sown re—
tain their fertility and come up several years
running.
