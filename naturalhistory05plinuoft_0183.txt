black fig, or as when a plane-trec at Laodicea changed
into an olive on the arrival of Xerxes. Not to launch
out into an absolutely boundlcss subject, the volume
by Aristander teems with portents of this nature
in Greece, as do the Notes of Gaius Epidius in our
own country, including cases of trees that talked.⁰
An alarming portent occurred a little before the
civil wars of Pompey the Great, when a tree in the
territory of Cumae sank into the ground leaving a
few branches projecting; and a statement was found

the portent had occurred the greater the slaughter
would be.

Another class of portent is when trees grow in the
wrong places, as on the heads of statues or on altars,
and when different kinds of trees grow on trees
themselves. At Cyzicus before the siege ⁶ a fig-tree

time of Caesar’s civil wars a palm grew up on the
pedestal of the dictator’s statue. Moreover at Rome
during the war with Perseus ⁰ a palm—trec grew up on
the altar of Jove on the Capitol, portending victory
and triumphal processions; and after this tree had
been brought down by storms, a fig- tree sprang up in
the same place, this occurring during the censorship‘ ‘l
of Marcus Messala and Gaius Cassius, a period which
according to so weighty an authority as Piso dates
the overthrow of the sense of honour. A portent
that will eclipse all those ever heard of occurred in
our own day in the territory of the Marrucini, at the
fall of the emperor Nero: an olive grove belonging
to a leading member of the equestrian order named
Vettius Marcellus bodily crossed the public highway,
