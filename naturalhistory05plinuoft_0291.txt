soil must be turned after every second blossoming.
The only kinds of soil it positively dislikes are chalky
and muddy soils, and in these it comes to nothing.
It is used as a food for mankind as well after being
steeped in hot water; as for cattle, a peck per head
of stock makes ample and strength-giving seed, while
it is also used medicinally for children as a poultice on
the stomach. lt suits the seed best to be stored in
a smoky place, as in a damp place maggots attack
the germ and reduce it to sterility. If lupine is
grazed off by cattle while in leaf, the only thing to
be done is to plough it in at once.

entails no labour for the sarmer‚ as it is sown after
only one furrowing‚ and it is not hoed or manured,
but only harrowed in. There are three seasons for
sowing it—about the time of the setting of Arcturus,
so that it may provide pasture in December—at that
date it is best sown for seed, for it bears seed just as
well when grazed down3 the second sowing is in
January, and the last in March, which is the best
crop for providing green fodder. Of all crops sown
vetch is the one that is fondest of a dry soil3 it does
not dislike even shady localities. If it is picked
when ripe, its grain supplies chaff that is preferred
to all others. If sown in a vineyard planted with
trees it takes away the juice from the vines and
makes them droop.

tivate. This needs weeding more than the vetch;
and it too has medicinal properties, indeed the fact
that his late Majesty Augustus was cured by it
stands on record in his own letters. Five pecks of
seed are enough for one yoke of oxen in a day.
