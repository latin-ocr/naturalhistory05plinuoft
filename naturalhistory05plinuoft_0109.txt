every country that. has a summer rainfall‚ but in
India and Ethiopia trees are necessarily planted later,
in autumn. Consequently there are three regular
periods for germination, spring and the rise of the
Dogstar and that of Arcturus. For in fact not only
do animals possess a strong appetite for copulation,
but the earth and all vegetable growths have a much
greater desire, the indulgence of which at the proper
season is of the greatest importance for conception,
and peculiarly so in the case ofgrafts, as both graft and
stock share a mutual eagerness to unite. Those who
approve of spring for grafting begin it immediately
after the equinox, stating that the buds are just
coming out, which facilitates the joining of the barks ;
but those who prefer autumn begin at the rising of
Arcturus, because the grafts at once so to speak take
root and are prepared when they reaeh springtime,
and do not have their strength taken away immedi-
ately by budding. Some kinds of trees however
have a fixed time of year everywhere, for instance
cherries and almonds, which have to be planted or
grafted about midwinter3 but as to the greater
number of trees the lie of the land will make the best
decision, as cold and damp lands must be planted in
spring, but dry and warm sites in autumn. The
system general in Italy at all events assigns the
times for planting in the following manner: for a
mulberry from February 13 to the spring equinox;
for a pear the autumn, provided it is not less than a
fortnight before the shortest day3 for summer apples
and quinces. and also sorbs and plums, from mid-
wintcr to February 13; for the Greek carob and for
peaches‚ right through autumn till midwinter3 for

the nuts, walnut and pine-cone and hazel and almond
