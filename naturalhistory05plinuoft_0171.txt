special names for each of these diseases. Conse-
quently they turn black, and first there is pain all over
and then the parts mentioned also become emaciated
and brittle‚ and lastly comes wasting consumption and
death, the sap not entering or not. permeating the
parts affected. Figs are extremely liable to this
disease‚ but the wild fig is immune from all the
maladies we have so far specified. Scab is caused
by gentle falls of dew occurring after the rising of
the Pleiads; for if the dew has been more copious
it gives the tree a good drenching‚ and does not
streak it with scab, although the green figs fall off3
but if there has been excessive rain a fig-tree is
liable to another malady due to dampness of the
roots.

In addition to worm-disease and star-blight vines
suffer from a disease of the joints that is peculiar to
them; it is due to three causes—first, loss of buds
owing to stormy weather, second, as noted by Theo-
phrastus‚ pruning done with an upward cut, and
third, damage caused by lael< of skill in theii culti-
vation· , for ball injuries to which vines are liable are
felt in their joints. One kind of star-blight is dew-
diseasc, when the grape—vines shed their blossoms,
or when the grapes shrivel up into a hard lump before
they grow big. V ines are also sickly when they have
been nippcd by cold, the eyes being injured by frost-
bite after the branches have been pruned. This also
happens owing to unseasonable hot weather, since
every thing depends on measure and on a fixed pro-
portion. Defects may also be caused by the fault of
the vine- -dicssers, when the vines are tied too tight,
