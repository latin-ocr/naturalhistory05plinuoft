BOOK XVIII. Lxxxn. 355-Lxxxv. 359

If a number of clouds spread like fleeces of wool in
the east, they will presage rain lasting three days.
W'hen clouds settle down on the tops ofthe mountains,
the weathei· will be stormy3 but if the tops become
clear, it will turn fine. When there is heavy white
cloud, 3 hailstorm, a ‘white storm ’ as it is called,
will be imminent. A pateh of cloud how ever small
seen in a fine sky will give a storm of wind.

LXXXIII. ¹&lists coming down from the mountains
or falling from the sky or ”settling in the valleys will
promise ofine w eather.

LXXXIV. Next after these, signs are given by
sires on the earth. When they are pallid and craek-
ling they are perceived as messengers of storms3 also
it is a sign of rain if fungus forms in lamps, and if the
flame is spiral and flickering. When the lights go out
of themselves or are hard to light, they announce wind ;
and so do sparks piling up on the top of a copper pot
hanging over the fire, or live coal sticking to saucepans
when you take them off the fire,or if when the fire is
banked up it sends out a seattering of ashes or emits
a spark, or if cinders on the hearth eake together and
if a coal fire glows with extreme brilliance.

LXXXV. &vater also gives signs. If when the sea

is calm the water in a harbour sways about or makes

a splashing noise of its own, it foretells wind, and if

it does so in winter, rain as well3 if the coasts and
shores re-echo during a calm, they foretell a severe
storm, as also do noises from the sea itself in 3 calm,
or scattered flakes of foam, or bubbles on the water.
Jelly-flsh on the surface of the sea portend several
days’ storm. Often also the sea swells in silence, and
blown up in unusually high waves confesses that the
winds are now inside it.
