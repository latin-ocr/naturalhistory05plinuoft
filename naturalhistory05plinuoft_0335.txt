the system of the actual days of the year and that‘¹ “sm ’¹'⁰⁷'²¹‘
of thc movement of the sun, because to the 365
days an intercalary year adds a quarter of a day
and of a night, and consequently definite periods of
the stars cannot be stated. In addition to this
there is the admitted obscurity of the facts, as
sometimes the specification of the seasons runs in
advance, and by a considerable number of days
(the Greek term ‘¹ for this is προχειμάζειιι), whereas at
other times it comes behind (in Greek ἐπιχειμάζειν),
and in general the influence of the heavens falls
down to the earth in one place more quickly and
in another place more slowly3 this is the cause of
the remark we commonly hear on the return of
fine weather‚ that a constellation has been com-
pleted. Moreover although all these things depend
on stars that are stationary and fixed in the sky,
there intervene movements of stars and hailstorms
and rain, these also having no inconsiderable effect,
as we have shown⁷ and they disturb the regularity 5152.
of the expectation that has been conceived. And
we must not think that this occurs only to oursclves—
it also deceives the rest of the animals, which have
greater sagacity about this matter, inasmuch as it is
a thing on which their life depends; and the birds
of summer are killed by exceptionally late or ex-
ceptionally early frosts, and those of winter by un-
timely spells of heat. This is why Virgil teaches the Ge0r0.1.3⁸5.
