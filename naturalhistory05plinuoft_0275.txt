in Greek ‘select grade ’. Still these products have
not yet got their whiteness for which they are dis-
tinguished, though even at this stage they are pre-
ferable to the Alexandrian alica. In a subsequent
process, marvellous to relate, an admixture of chalk
is added, which passes into the substance of the grain
and contributes colour and fineness. The ehalk is
found at a place called White Earth Hill‚ between
Pozzuoli and Naples, and there is extant. a decree of
