and by means of levers: but within the last hundred
years the Greek pattern of press has been invented,
with the grooves of the upright beam running spirally,
some makers fitting the tree with a star, but with
others the tree raises with it boxes of stones, an
arrangement which is very highly approved. Within
the last twenty years a plan has been invented to
use small presses and a smaller pressing-shed, with
a shorter upright bearn running straight down into
the middle, and to press down the drums placed on
top of the grape-skins with the whole weight and to
pile a heap of stones above the presses. This is also
the time for gathering fruit; one should watch when
any falls off owing to ripeness and not because of
windy w eather. 'Ihis is also the s( ason for pressing

vine nor from one growing on marshy ground; and
only a ripe bunch should be used. It is thought that
if wood is brought in contact with the vesseL the
liquor gets a burnt and smoky flavour. The proper
time for the vintage is the period of 44 days from the
equinox to the setting of the Pleiads; we meet with
a wise saying of growers who hold that from that day
onward it is no good at all to tar a cold wine- -butt.
Still, before now I have seen vintagers at work even

being poured out of the casks to make room for new
wine of doubtful quality. This is not 5ο often due
to an over-abundant crop as to slackness‚ or else to
