not to lay them down on the surface of the earth and
let them be dried up by the sun and nipped by wind
or frost. Shoots that have been left too long in a
dry place should be soaked in water for several days
to restore their freshness.

The soil whether in a nursery or a vineyard should

be exposed to the sun and should be as soft as possible, ·

and it should be turned over with a tu'o-pronged fork
three feet down, and thrown back with a two-spit
spade or mattock to swell naturally in ridges four
feet high, so that each trench goes down two feet;
and when dug the earth must be cleaned of weeds and
spread out, so that no part may be left uncultivated,
and it must be levelled accurately by measurement:
unequal ridges show that the ground has been badly
dug. The part of the ground lying between the
banks must also be measured. Shoots are planted
either in a hole or in a longer trench. and the finest
possible layer of earth is heaped over thern, although
in a thin soil this is of no use unless a layer of richer
soil is spread underneath. The earth should cover
up not fewer than two buds and should just touch
the third; it must be pressed down to the same
level and compacted with the dibble3 in the nursery
plot there should be spaees eighteen inches broad
and six inches long-ways between every two settings ;
and the mallet-shoots so planted should after two
years be cut back to their bottom knot, if the knot
itself is spared. From this point they throw out the
substance of eyes, with which at the end of three
years the quickset is planted.

There is also a luxury method of growing vines—
to tie four mallet-slmots together at the bottom with
a tight string and so pass them through the shank
