a plan first adopted with elders, quinces and
brambles, which were planted for the purpose of
making a hcdgc, but later it was also introduced as a
way of growing trees, for instance poplars‚ alders,
and willow, which last is even planted with the cutting

off the cold; and he says that this is the method for
rearing pear and apple seeds, and pine eones, and also
