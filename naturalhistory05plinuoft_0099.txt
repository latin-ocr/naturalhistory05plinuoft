was laden with fruit of every kind, nuts on one
branch, berries on another, while in other places
hung grapes, pears, figs, pomegranates and various
sorts of apples3 but the tree did not live long. And
nevertheless it is impossible for us by our experi-
ments to attain to all the things found in Nature, as
some cannot possibly come into existence except
spontaneously, and these only occur in wild and unin-
habited places. The tree most receptive of every
kind of graft is believed to be the plane, and next
to it the hard-oak‚ but both of these spoil the flavours
of the fruit. Some trees, for instance the fig and
the pomegranate, can be grafted in all the different
methods, but the vine does not admit 50111011οο115,

is the most prolific of all methods of grafting, and
grafting by scutcheon comes next, but both arc
very subject to displacement; and a graft that relies

lodged by even a light breeze. Grasting by insertion
is the firmest, and produces more fruit ’th-m a trec
