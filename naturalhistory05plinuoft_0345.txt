periods are also divided by particular moments of
time, all of them at midday—since between the
solstice and the autumna] equinox the setting of the
Lyre on the 46th day marks the beginning ofautumn,
and from that equinox to midwinter the morning
Setting of the Pleiads on the 44th day marks that of
winter, and between midwinter and the equinox the
prevalence of a west wind on the 45th day marks the
period of spring, and the morning rising of the Pleiads
on the 47th day from the spring equinox marks the
beginning of summer. We will start from sowing—time
of wheat, that is from the morning setting of the
Pleiads3 and we need not interrupt our explanation
and increase the difficulty of the subject by mention-
ing the minor stars, inasmuch as it is at the same
date that the stormy constellation of Orion sets after
its extensive course.

LX. Most people anticipate the times for sowing,
and begin to sow corn at the eleventh day of the
autumnal equinox, as for nine days after the rising
of the Crown there is an almost certain expectation
of rain. But Xenophon tells us not to begin before
the Deity has given the signal—this our Rom· an
author Ciceroa understood as being donc by a fall
of raim although the true method is not to sow
before the leaves have begun to fall. Some think
that this occurs exactly at the setting of the Pleiads
on November 10, as we have said, and even clothes-
dealers go by that constellation‚'¹ and it is very easy
to identify in the sky3 consequently dealers out

make forecasts as to the winter from its setting: thus
by a cloudy setting it foretells a wct winter, and they
at once raise their prices for cloaks, whereas by a
