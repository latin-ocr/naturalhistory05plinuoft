a circular shape‚ as in the case of apples and pears,
whereas cherries and laurels throw exceptionally
wide shadows.

XVIII. We turn now to certain special propeitieso ⁶1⁰

of the shade of different trees. That of walnut is οἵ ode

heavy, and even causes headache ln man and injury to
anything planted in its vicinity; and that of the pine

tree also kills grass3 but both the pine and the walnut
withstand wind, as also their projecting branches
shield them like pent-houses. Very heavy raindrops
fall from the pine, oak and holm-oak‚ but none at all
from the cypreSS‚ which throws a very small compact
shadow around it ; and fig-trees give only a light
shadow, however much spread out, ‘ind consequently
it is not necessary to make it 1 rule not to pl int them
between vines. Elms give a gentle shade which actu-

ally promotes the growth of any plants that it falls on,

although Atticus holds the view that also the shade of
elms is one ofthe most oppressiv e, nor do I doubt that
it is so if they are allowed to shoot out into bmnches,
although l do not think that the shade of the clm does
any harm when the tree is kept within bounds. The
shade of the plane also though dense is agrecable, as
we may learn from the evidence of graSS‚ which under
no other tree covers the banks more luxuriantly.
The poplara with its gaily quivering leaves gives no
shade at all3 the shade of the alder is dense but
permits the growth of plants. The vine gives
enough shade for itselfi as its quivering foliage
and constant tossing tempers the sunshinc with
shadow, while by the same means it affords shclter
in a heavy shower of rain. Nearly all trees of
which the leaves have long stalks afford only light
shade.
