is also reported that the same thing may be caused by
a jackdaw when it hides seeds in the holes that are
its storehouses.

of inoculation, consisting in opening an eye in a tree
by cutting away the bark with a tool resembling a
shoemaker’s puneh and enclosing in it a seed that has
been removed from another tree by means of the
same tool. This was the method of inoculation used in
old days in the case of figs and apples ; but the method
described by Virgil ‘² is to find a recess in a knot ofbark
burst open by a shoot and to enclose in this a bud
obtained from another tree.

XXIV. And so far Nature has herself been our &ostiam
instructor3 but grafting was taught us by Chance, ss'fflssss'ssse
another tutor and one who gives us perhaps more
frequent Iessons‚ and this was how he did it: a
careful farmer, making a fence round his house
to protect it, put under the posts a base made
of ivy-wood, so as to prevent them from rotting3
but the posts when nipped by the bite of the still
living ivy created life of their own from another’s
vitality, and it was found that the trunk of a tree
was serving instead of earth. Continuing, the sur-
face of the wood is levelled off with a saw and the
trunk smoothed with a pruning-knife. Afterwards
there is a two-sold method of procedure ; and the first
method eonsists of inserting the graft between b the
bark and the wood, as people in former days were
afraid of making a cleft in the trunk; although sub-
sequently they ventured to bore right into the middle
and adopted the plan of forcing the graft into the
pith itself inside it, inserting only one graft as the
