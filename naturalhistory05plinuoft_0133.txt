medium density should be five feet, and in a rich
soil four feet at least, and in a thin soil eight feet at
most—growers in Umbria and Marsia leave a space
of up to twenty feet to allow of ploughing between
the rows, in the case of the vineyards for which the
local name is ‘ ridged fields ’ 3 vines should be planted
further apart in a rainy and misty district but closer
together in a dry one. Elaborate economy has dis-
covered a way of saving space, when planting a vine-
yard on ground that has been wcll dug over, by
making a nursery-bed at the same time, so that while
the quickset is planted in the place it is to occupy,
the mallet-shoot is also planted, so that it may be
transplanted between the vines as well as between
the rows of props ; this plan gives about 16,ΟΟΟ quick-
sets in an acre of ground, while it makes ιι difference
of two years’ fruit, as a planted quic-kset bears two
years later than a transplanted mallet-shoot.

cut back right down to the ground, leaving only one
eye above the surfacc; a stake is fixed close to the
plant, and dung is added. In the following year also
it is again loppe'd 1n a similar w ay, and it acquires and
fosters within it sufficient strength to bear the burden
of reproduction. Otherwise in its hurry to bear it
would shoot up slim and meagre like a bulrush and
unless it were rcstrained with the pruning described
would spend itself entirely on growth. No tree sprouts
more eagerly than the vine, and unless its strength
is kept for bearing, it turns entirely into growth.
