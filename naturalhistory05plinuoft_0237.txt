turnip autumn-sowing grains. In the class of wheat
one division consists of fodder sown for animals, such
as mixed seed, and the sanie also in the leguminous
plants, such as vet0h3 but lupine is grown for the use
of animals and men in common.

All the leguminous plants except the bean have
a single root, which has a woody substance because
it is not divided into many branches3 the chick-pea
has the deepest root. Corn has a number of fibrous
roots without ramifications. Barley bursts out of the
ground seven days α after it is first sown, leguminous
plants on the fourth day, or at latest the seventh,
beans from fifteen to twenty days; in Egypt legu-
minous plants emerge on the third day. In barley
one end of the grain sends out a root and the other
a blade, which ssowers before the other corn3 and
the root shoots out from the thicker end of the grain
and the flower from the thinner, whereas with all
other seeds both root and flower come from the same
end.

Corn is in the blade during winter3 in the spring
time corn of the winter variety shoots up into a stalk,
but common and Italian rnillets into a knotted hollow
straw, and sesame into a stalk like fennel. The fruit
of all kinds of sown grain is either contained in ears,
as in the case of wheat and barley, and is protected
against birds and small animals by a fence of heard,
or is enclosed in pods, as with leguminous plants,
or in capsules‚ as with sesame and poppy. Both
millets are accessible also to small birds, in what can
only be called joint ownership with the grower,
inasmuch as th( 3 are cont ained in thin skins, leaving
them unprotected. Panic, named from its panieles lca lim
