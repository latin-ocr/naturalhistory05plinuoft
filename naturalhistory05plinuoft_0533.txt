method of cultivation tried later has proved to be
more useful‚ except that they now sow about Feb—
ruary 13 by digging in the seed in he ips in little
trenches‚ usually preparing the seed by soaking it in
dung; as a result of this process the roots twine
together and form tufts, uhich they plant out at
spaces of a foot apart after the autumn equinox‚ the
plants going on bearing for ten years. There is no
soil that asparagus likes better than that of the
kitchen-gardens at Ravenna, as we have pointed out.
I fmd it stated that corruda (which I take to be a wild
asparagus, called by the Greeks horminos or myacan-

remain an extremely profitable article of trade which
must be mentioned not without a feeling of shame.
The fact is it is well known that at Carthage and par-
ticularly at Cordova crops of thistlesa yield a return of
6000 sesterces from small plots—sinee we turn even
the monstrosities of the earth to purposes osgluttony,
and actually grow vegetables which all four-footed
beasts without exception shrink from touching.
Thistles then we grow in two ways, from a slip planted
in autumn and from seed sown before March 7,
the seedlings from which are planted out before
November 13, or in cold localities about the season⁶
of the west wind. They are sometimes manured as
well. if heaven so wills‚ and come up more abundantly.
They are also preserved in honey diluted with vinegar,
with the addition of laserwort root and cummin,
so that there may be no day without thistles for
dinner.
