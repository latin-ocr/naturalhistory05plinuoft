should grow for the poor. We will now therefore
state in what manner it chiefly comcs about that such a
large revenue is derived from these trees, going on to
set forth the genuine and perfect method of cultiva-
tion, and for that purpose we shall not treat of the
commonly known facts and those which we observe to
be established, but of uncertain and doubtful points
on which practical conduct chiefly goes wrong 3 as it is
not our plan to give careful attention to superfluities.
But first of all we will speak about matters of climate
and soil that concern all kinds of trees in common.
II. Trees are specially fond of a north-east α aspect,

wind in that quarter rendering their foliage denser ’,ᾗ

and more abundant and their timber stronger. This
is a point on which most people make a mistake‚ as the
props in a vineyard ought not to be placed so as to
shelter the stems from wind in that quarter‚ and this
precaution should only be taken against a north wind.
What is more, exposure to cold at the proper season
contributes very greatly to the strength of the trees,
and they bud best under those circumstances, as
otherwise, if exposed to the caresses of the winds from
the south-west, they languish‚ and especially when in
blossom. In fact if the fall of the blossom is followed
immediately by rain, the fruit is entirely ruined—so
much so that almonds and pears lose their crop of fruit
if the weather should be only cloudy or a south-west
wind prevail. Rain at the rising ofthe Pleiads b indeed
is extremely unfavourable for the vine and the olive,
because that is their fertilizing season ; this is the four-
day period that decides the fate ofthe olive& this is the
critical point when a south wind brings the dirty clouds
wc spoke of. Also cereals ripen worse on (lays when
the wind is in the south-west, though they ripen faster.
