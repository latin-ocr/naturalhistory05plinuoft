grain is however rice, of which they make a drink
like the barley-water made by the rest of mankind.
Rice leaves are fleshy, resembling leek but broader3
the plant is 18 inches high, with a purple blossom
and a root ofa round shape like a precious stone.

XIV. Barley is the oldest among human foods, as oses ο]
is proved by the Athenian ceremonyss recorded by ''arm‘'
Menander, and by the name given to gladiator-s, who
used to be called ‘ barley-men'. Also the Greeks
prefer it to any other grain for porridge. There are
several ways of making barley pori-idge: the Greeks
soak some barley in water and then leave it for a
night to dry, and next day dry it by the fire and
then grind it in a mill. Some after roasting it more
thoroughly sprinkle it again with a small amount of
water and dry it before milling; others however
shake the young barley out of thc ears while green,
clean it and while it is wet pound it in a mortar, and
wash it of husk in baskets and then dry it in the sun
and again pound it, clean it and grind it. But what-
ever kind of barley is used, when it has been got
ready, in the mill they mix in three pounds of flax
seed, half a pound of coriander seed, and an eighth
of a pint of salt, previously roasting them all. Those
who want to keep it for some time in store put it
away in new earthenware jars with fine flour and its
own bran. Italians bake it without steeping it in
water and grind it into fine meal‚ with the addition
of the same ingredients and millet as well.

XV. Barley bread was much used in earlier days,
but has been condemned by experience‚ and barley is
now mostly fed to animals, although the consumption
of barley-water is proved so conclusively to be very Barley-
