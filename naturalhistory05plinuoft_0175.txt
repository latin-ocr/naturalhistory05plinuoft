medlars and pomegranates; but in the case of the
olive an attack of worm 1135 3 two-sold result, inas-
much as if they breed under the skin they destroy
the fruit, while if they have been in the actual stone,
gnawing it away, they make the fruit larger. Rain
following the rising of Arcturus prev ents their
breeding3 and also if this rain is accompanied by a
south wind it breeds w orms in half· —ripe oliv es as well,
which are then particul 111) liable to fall off when
ripening. This happens particularly with olives in
damp localities, making them very unattractive even
if they do not drop off. There is also a kind of gnat
troublesome to some fruits, for instance acorns and
figs, which appears to be bred from the sweet juice α
secreted underneath the bark at that season; and
indeed these trees are usually sickly.

Some influences of seasons or localities cannot
properly be called diseases, since they cause instan-
taneous death, for instance when a tree is attacked
by wasting or blast, or by the effect of a special
wind prevailing in a particular district, like the
sirocco in Apulia or the Olympias wind in Euboea,
which if it blows about midwinter shrivels up trees
with dry cold so that no amount of subsequent sun-
shine can revive them. This kind of blight infests
narrow valleys and trees growing by rivers, and
particularly vines, olive and fig rs; and when this 1135
occurred, it is at once detectedo at the budding season,
though rather later 111 the case of olives. But it is a
sign of rccovery in all of them if they lose their
leaves3 failing that, the trees which one would
suppose to have been strong enough to rcsist the
attack die. Sometimes however the leaves dry on
the trce and then come to life again. Other trees
