ground, so that it may not shoot from the place where
it was cut off. As for a quickset, it should be removed
immediately after the vintage.

A plan has recently been invented of planting a
snake—branch near the tree—-that is our name for
a veteran main branch that has grown hard with
many years' service. The quickcst plan in the case
of a vine is to cut this old branch off as long as pos-
sible and serape the bark off three-quarters of its
length, down to the point to which it is to be buried
in the ground—for this reason it is also called a
‘ scraped ' shoot—and then to press it down in the
furrow, with the remaining part standing straight up
against the tree. If the vine be meagre or the soil
thin, it is customary to cut down the plant as close
to the ground as possible, until the root gets strong,
and likewise not to plant it when there is dew on it,
nor in a place exposed to a north wind3 the vines
themselves ought to face north-east, but their young
shoots should have a southerly aspect.

There must be no hurry to prune a young vine, but

circular shapes, and no pruning should be applied
except to a strong plant, a vine trained on a tree being
about a year later in bearing fruit than one trained
on a cross-bar. Some people forbid pruning al-
together until the vine equals the tree in height.
At the first pruning it should be cut back six feet
from the ground, a shoot being left below and en-
couraged to grow by bending over the wood. It
should have three buds and not more left when it
has been pruned. In the following year the branches
sent out from these should be spread out on the
lowest stages of the trees and allowed to climb to
