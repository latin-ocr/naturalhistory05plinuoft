eaten down as pasture have to be resuscitated with
the hoe. But in Bactria and Africa and at Cyrene
all these operations are rendered superfluous by the
indulgence of the climate, and after sowing they only
go back into the fields at harvest, because the dry
atmosphere prevents weeds‚ the omps depending for
nourishment on the dew-fall at night. V irgil advises
letting the fields ‘ lie fallow turn and turn about ’,α and
if the extent of the farm allows it, this is undoubtedly
extremely usefu13 but if conditions forbid it,

that enrich the land. And another point to be noticed
as of first importance is this, that somc interim crops

supply, but nevertheless it is distributcd among the
population only at special fixed periods of the day.
Here underneath palms of exceptional sizc there

ncath the vines is sown corn. and later lcguminous
plants, and then garden vegetables, all in the same
year, and all nourished in the shade of something else.
