farmer who trains less than three on each. It
damages any but strong trees to wed vines to them,
as the rapid growth of the vinc-s kills them off. It is
essentia] to plant the vines in a trench three feet
deep, with a space of a foot between them and the
tree3 this saves the need of a mallet-shoot and of
turning over the ground and the expense of digging,
inasmuch as this method of using a tree has the
special advantage that for the same ground to carry
corn actually benefits the vines, and moreover that
the height of the vine looks after itself, and does not
make it necessary, as in a vineyard, to guard it with a
wall or hedge, or at all events by going to the expense
of ditches, so as to protect it from injury by animals.

In growing vines on a trec the only method used
among those already described is that of quicksets or
of layers; and of layering there are two varieties, as
we have said: that of using baskets projecting from
the actual staging of thc tree‚ the most approved
method, as it is safest from cattle, and the other one
by bending down a vine or a main branch at the side
ofits own tree or round the nearest to it not occupied.
It is recommended that the part of the parcnt tree
above the ground should be scraped, to prevent it
from making shoots3 and not less than four buds are
covered up in the ground so as to take root, while
two are left above ground on the head. A vine grown
on a trec is set in a trench four feet long, three broad
and two and a half deep. After a year a cut is made
in the layer down to the cambium, so that it may grad-
ually get used to its roots, and the stem is pruned back
at its end down to two buds from the ground; and
at the end of two years the layer is completely cut
off from the stock and is put back deeper into the
