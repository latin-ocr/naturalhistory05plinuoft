BOOK XVIII. x1,v1. 166-xnv11. 169

The only portent arising from grain crops that Ι A ponentem
for my part have come across occurred in the consul- ⁹⁷⁰w‘h·
ship of Publius Aelius and Gnaeus Cornelius, the
year in which Hannibal was overconie ‘² ; it is stated ὁ
that on that occasion corn grew on trees.

the kinds of grain and of soil, we will now speak about ffofsoffifssffiy
the method of ploughing‚ beginning with an account ggfwlrlffig'gd
of the easy conditions prevailing in Egypt. In that '
country the Nile plays the part of farmer, beginning
to overflow its banks at the new moon in midsunnner‚
as we have said, at first gently and then more V·⁶⁷·
violently, as long as the sun is in the constellation
of the Lion. Then when the sun has passed over
into the Virgin it slows down, and when the sun
is in the Scales it subsides. If it has not risen
more than 18 feet, there is certain to be a famine,
and likeuise if it has exceeded 24 feet3 for it
retires more slowly in proportion as it has risen in
greater flood, and prevents the sowing of seed. It
used to be commonly believed that the custom was
to begin sowing after the subsidence of the Nile and
then to drive swine over the ground, pressing down
the seed in the damp soil with their footprints, and Ι
believe that in former days this was the common
practice, and that at the present day also the sowing
is done without much heavier labour; but nevel-the-
less it is certain that the seed is first scattered in the
mud of the river after it has subsided and then
ploughed in. This is done at the beginning of
November, and afterwards a few nien stub up the
weeds—their name for this process is botanismus—,
but the rest of the labourers only visit the fields a
little before the first of April, taking a sickle with
