after the grain has begun to fill out but its growth
is not yet mature, before it makes a strong body it
becomes hollow and empty owing to some noxious
blast and fades away in the ear by a sort of abortion.
Wind is injurious to wheat and barley at three other cause

grain, while in the preceding cases its influence is to
prohibit the seed from forming. Successive gleams
of sun appearing out of cloud are also injurious.
Also maggots breed in the root when after rains
following seed-time a sudden spell of heat has en-
closed the moisture in the ground. They also grow
in the grain when heat following rain causes the ear
to ferment. There is also a small beetle called the
cantharis which gnaws away corn crops. When food
fails, all these creatures disappear. Olive oil, pitch
and grease are detrimental to seeds, and care must
be taken not to let seed come in contact with them
before it is sown. Rain is beneficial to crops while
in the stalk from the time of germination, but it
damages wheat and barley when in blossom; al-
though it does no harm to leguminous plants, ex-
cepting chick—pea. Corn crops when beginning to
ripen are damaged by rain, and particularly barley.
Also there is a white grass like Italian millet that
springs up all over the fields, and is also fatal to
cattle. As for dax-nel, culti-ops, thistle and bur,
I should not count these any more than brambles
among diseases of cereals, but rather among pesti-
lences of the soil itself. One of the most harmful
climatic maladies of corn erops and vines is rust.
This is most frequent in a district exposed to dew
