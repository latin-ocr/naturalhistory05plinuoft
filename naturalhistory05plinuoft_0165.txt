and, if it is intended to keep the grapes for raisins,
when the moon is on the wanc, but that those cut
between thc old moon and the new are immune from
all kinds of insects. Another theory holds the opinion
that vines should be pruned by night at full moon when
the moon is in the Lion or Scorpion or Archer or
Bull; and in general that they should be planted
when the moon is at full, or at all events is waxing.
In Italy a gang of ten farmhands is enough for a
hundred ael es of vineyard.

XXXV II. And having treated of the planting and
cultivation of trees with sufficient fullness‚ since we
have said enough 1bout palms and t1 ee -medick among
foreign trees, in order that nothing may be lacking
a statement must be given of the other natural
features of great importance in relation to all these
matters. For even trees are liable to attacks of
disease—since what created object is exempt from
these evils? But forest trees at all events are said
not to have any deadly diseases and only to be liable
to damage by hail w hen they are budding or in flower,
and also to be nipped by heat or exceptionally cold
wmd coming out of scason‚ for cold w eather in its
proper season actually docs them good, as we have
stated. ¹ What then? ’ it will be said. ⁴ Does not frost
kill even vines ?’ Well, that is how a fault of soil is
detected, because it only happens on chilly ground.
And consequently we approve of cold in winter time
that is due to the climate and not to the soil. And
it is not the weakest trees that are endangered by
frost‚ but the largest ones, and when they are thus
attacked it is their tops that dry away first, because
the sap has been congealcd and has not been able
to get there.
