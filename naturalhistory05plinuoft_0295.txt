same of chickling for each acre of land and sow this
mixture in autumn preferably with some Greek oats
mixed in as well, as this does not drop its seed; he
says that the usual name for this mixture w as ocinum,
and that it used to be grown for cattle. V arro

riving it from the Greek word for ‘ quickly '.

been imported from Media during the Persian inva-
sions under Darius3 but so great a bounty deserves
mention even among the first of the grains, since
from a single sowing it will last more than thirty
years. In stalk and leaf it resembles trefoil‚ being
jointed, and as the stalk rises highcr the leaves
become narrower. Amphilochus devoted one volume
to lucerne and tree-medick. The land for it to be

stones and weeded, and is afterwards ploughed over
and harrowed and then covered with chalk, the pro-
cess being repeated a second and a third time at
intel-vals of fiv e days, and after the addition ofmanure
—it requires a dry and rich soil or else a well— 1-1 atered
one—and after the land has been thus prepared
the seed is somn in May, as otherwise it is liable to
damage from frost. It is necessary for the whole
plot to be occupied with closely sown seed, and for
weeds shooting up in between to be debarred—this
is secured by sowing three modii to the acre-, and
care must be taken that the sun may not scorch the
seed up, and it ought to be covered over with earth
immediately. If the soil be damp or weedy, the
lucerne is overpowered and goes off into meadow;
consequently as soon as it is an inch high it must be
freed from all weeds, by hand in preference to hocinff.
