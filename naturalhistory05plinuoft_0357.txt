hoe barley in dry weather. You should have your
pruning finished by the equinox. An acre of vine-
yard takes four hands to prune, and tying up the
vines on a trec takes one hand for each fifteen trees.‘²
This is the time moreover for kitchen-gardcns and
rose-bcds to be attended to, a subject which will be
dealt with separately in the following Books, and it
is also the time for landscape gardcning3 and then
is the best occasion for making ditches. The ground
is now opened for future operatfflns, as Virgil in par-
ticular advises, to allow the sun thoroughly to dry
the clods. The more useful opinion recommends
ploughing only ground of medium quality in the
middle of spring, because in a rich soil the furrows
are at once seized on by weeds and in a thin soil the
spells of beat that follow dry them up and take away
all moisture from the seeds that are to come3 there
is no question that it is best to plough land of these
sorts in the autumn.

The following are the rules given by Catob for
operations in spring: ‘ to make ditches for the seed-
plots, layer vine—numeries, plant chus, figs, fruit-trees
and olives in thick and damp soils, under a dry
moon to manure meadows that are not going to be
irrigated‚ and to protect them from westerly winds,
and to clean them and root up noxious weeds3 to
prune fig-trees lightly‚ make new seed-beds and rcpair
old ones—these operations to bc done before you
begin to dig over the vineyard.’ Cato also says:
‘You should begin to plough thin and sandy soils

the successively heaviest and wcttest lands last of
all.’ Consequently there will be two signs for this
