method used by certain people that luck is kind to
them and brings a good return. Seed should not be
transferred from cold places to warm ones nor from
early ripening districts to late ones, and nothing
should be transferred in the contrary directions
either, as some people out of mistaken ingenuity
have advised.

LV. The right amounts os seed per acre to sow in
soil of medium quality are : bare 01· common wheat 5
pecks, emmer or seed (the kind of graina to which
we give that name) 10; barley 6, beans 3 fifth more
than in the case of wheat, vetch 12, chick-pea‚
chickling vetch and pcas 3, lupine 10, lentil 3 (but

people like to sow lentils mixed with dry dung),
bitter xetch 6, fenugreek 6, calavances 4, hay-

grass 20, common ande Italian millets 3 quarter of a
peck, or more in 3 rich soil and less in a thin one.
There is also another distinction to make: in thick
or chalky or moist soil 6 pecks of bare or common
wheat, but in loose and dry and fertile soil 4; for
3 meagre soil makes 3 small and empty ear unless
it has the corn stalks far apart, whereas fields with
a rich soil produce a number of stalks from a single
seed and yield 3 thick crop from ῖὴίηῙ) scattered
seed. Consequently the rule given is to sow be-
tw een four and six peel-18, adding or subtracting a
fifth in accordance with the nature of the soil, and
the same in a densely planted place or on sloping
land as in thin soil. To this applies that oracular
litterance, which it is so important to observet ‘ Do
not grudge the cornfield its seed.’ To this Attius in his
Praxidike added the advice to sow when the moon
is in the constellations of the Ram, the Twim, the
Lion, the Scales and AquariuS, but Zoroaster advised
