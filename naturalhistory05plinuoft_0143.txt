ground in this manner, inasmuch as this eustom
prevails both in Africa and in Egypt and Syria and
the whole of Asia and at many places in Europe.
In these vineyards therefore the vine ought to be
kept down close to the ground, nourishment being
given to the root in the same way and at the same
time as in the case of a vine trained on a cross-bar‚
*care being always taken to leave merely the pruned
stuinps, with three buds on each in fertile land and
two where the soil is thinner, and it pays better to
have many of them than to have long oneS. The
properties of soil that we have spoken of will make
themselves felt more powerfully the nearer the
bunches of grapes are to the ground.

It pavs best to keep the different kinds of vine mun-burim

a mixture of different varicties spoils the flavour
even in the wine and not only in the must; or if
they are mixed, it is essential not to combine any
but those that ripen at the same time. The richer
the soil and the more level the ground the greater
the height of the eross-bars required, and high cross-
bars also suit land liable to dew and sog and where
there is comparatively little wind, whereas lower bars
suit thiu, dry and parched land and places exposed
to the wind. The cross-bars should be tied to the
prop as tightly as possible, but the vine should be
kept together with an easy tie. We stated what xivam.

The remaining points connected with the cultiva- omer paim
