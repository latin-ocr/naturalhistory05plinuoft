working and for the crops. We need only try to see
the meaning of this remarkably significant expression
‘ tender '‚ and we shall discover that the term com-
prises every desideratum. ‘ Tender ' soil is soil of
moderate richness‚ a soft and easily worked soil,
neither damp nor parched; it is soil that shines
behind the ploughshare, like the field which Homer,

the fountain- head of all genius, has desc1·ibed<2as re-

presented by a divine artist in a carving on a shield,

and he has added the marv ellous touch about the
furrow showing black although the matelial used
to represent it was gold3 it is the soil that when
freshly turned attracts the rascally birds which ac-

company the ploughshare and the tribe of crows
which peck the very footplints of the ploug ‹hman.

In this place moreove1 rnay be quoted a dictum
as to luxury that is also undoubtedly to the point.
Cicero, that other luminaiy of learning, says 1>⁴U,n
guents with an earthy taste are better than those
with the flavour of saffron ¹—he preferred the word
‘ taste ’ to ‘ srnell ’. It is certainly the case that a soil
which has a taste of perfume will be the best soil.
And if we need an explanation as to what is the
nature of this odour of the soil that is desiderated‚ it
is that which often occurs even when the ground is
not being turned up, just towards sunset, at the place
where the ends of rainbows have come down to earth,
and when the soil has been drenched with rain follow-
ing a long period of drought. The earth then sends
out that divine brcath of hers, of quite incomparable
sweetness‚ which she has conceived from the sun. Thjs
is the odour which ought to be emitted when the earth
is turned up, and when found it will deceive no one3
and the scent of the soil will be the best criterion ofits
