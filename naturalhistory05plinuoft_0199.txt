people kill ants and also moles with the dregs of
olive oil, and to protect the tops of the trees against
caterpillars and pests productive ofdecay they advise
touching them with the gall of a green lizard, but
as a protection against caterpillars in particular they
say that a woman just beginning her monthly
courscs should walk round each of the trees with
bare feet and her girdle undone. Also to prevent
any creature from injuring the foliage by noxious
nibbling they recommend sprinkling the leaves with
cow-dung mixed with water every time there is a
shower of rain, as the rain smcars the poison of the
mixture over the tree: so remarkable are some of
the devices invented by human skill‚ inasmuch as
most people believe that hailstorms can be averted
by means of a charm, the words of which I would
not for my own part venture seriously to introduce
into my book, although Cato has published the words oux,
of a charrn for sprained limbs which have to be ‘LXXXIX‘
bandaged to reed splints. The same author has
allowed the felling of consecrated trees and groves
after a preliminary sacrifice has been performed, the
ritual of which and the accompanying prayer he has
reported in the same volume.
