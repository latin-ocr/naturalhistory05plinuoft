This restrictiori must be so c·1rehillv managed that
the vine may still want to grow 1· ather tha ιιι to bear.

The main branc-h should have two or thrce buds
below the cross-bar from which uood may be. pro-
duced, and then it should be stretehed out along
the bar and fied to it, so as to be held up by ily. not
to hang down from it, and then after the third bud
it should be fastened more tightly to it by means of
a tie, because that also has the effect of resti aining
the outgrouth of the wood and causing ιι more
abundant outburst of shoots short of the tic· , but it
is forbidden to tie the end of the main branch. The
nature of the vine is that the part hanging down or
bound with a ligature yields fruit, and most of all
the actual curve of the bmnch, but that which is
short of the ligature makes wood, Ι suppose because

will bear fruit in the following year. Thus there
are two kinds of main branches3 the shoot which
comes out of the hard timber and promises w ood for

which uill provide wood next year if the vine’s
luxurious grouth has uscd itself up—-and another
shoot next to it, the size ofa wart, called the pilferer‚
is also left, in case the keeper-shoot should fail.

A vine called on to produce fruit before it com-
pletes seven years from being planted as a slip
turns into a rusb-like growth and dies. Nor is it
