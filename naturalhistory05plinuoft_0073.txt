hand; Cato's view ‘¹ is that it ought to be more than
five inches thick. The same authority would not hav e
omitted, if it were important, to recommend making
a mark in the bark on the south side, so that when
trees were transplanted they might be set in the same
directions as regards the seasons as those to which
they were accustomed, to prevent their north sides
from being split if set facing the midday sun and
their south sides from being2³ nipped if facing the
north wind. Some people also follow the contrary
plan in the case of a vine or a fig, replanting
them turned the other way round, from the view
that this makes them grow thicker foliage and
afford better shelter to their fruit and be less liable
to lose it, and that a fig-tree so treated also be-
comes strong enough to be cli1nbed.⁶ Most pcople
only take care to make the wound left where the
end of a branch has been lopped face south, not being
aw are that this exposes it to cracks caused by exces-
sive heat; Ι should prefer to let a lopped end point
’ somew hat east ofsouth or somewhat w est ofsouth. It
is equally little known that care should be taken not
to let the roots become dry owing to delay in re—
planting‚ and not to dig up trees when the wind is in
the north or in any quartcr between north and south-
east, or at all events not to leave the roots exposed to
the wind in these quarters ; such exposure causes trees
to die without the growers knowing the cause. Cato ⁶
disapprovcs of wind in any quartcr and of rain also
during all the time while transplantation is going on.
It will be a good precaution against wind and rain to
leave as much as possible of the earth in which the
trees have been living clinging to their roots, and to
bind 'them all round with turf. though for this purpose
