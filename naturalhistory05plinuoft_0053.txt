BOOK XVII. v1. 54—vl1. 56

adds the employment of the lightest kind of horse-
dung for manuring cornfields, but for meadowland the
heavier manure produced by fceding barley to horses,
which produces an abundant growth of grass. Some
people even prefer stable-manure to cowdung and
sheeps' droppings to goats’‚ but they rate asses’ dung
above all othcr manures, because asses chew their
fodder very slowly3 but experience on the contrary
pronounces against each of these. It is however
universally agreed that no manure is more beneficia]
than a crop of lupine turned in by the plough or with
forks before the plants form pods, or else bundles of
lupine after it has been cut, dug in round the roots of
trees and vines; and in places where there are no
cattle they believe in using the stubble itself or even
bracken for manure.

Cato says ‘² : ‘You can make manure of stable-litter‚
lupines‚ chaff, bean-stalks and holm-oak or oak leaves.
Pull up the dane-wort and hemlock out of the crop,
and the high grass and sedge growing round osier
beds3 use this as litter for sheep, and rotten leaves
for oxen.'—‘ If a vine is making poor growth, make a
bonfire of its shoots and plough in the ashes there-
from.’ He also says: ‘ VVhere you are going to sow
corn, give your sheep a free run on the land.’

VII. Moreover Cato also says ὁ that there are certain crops that
crops which themselves nourish the land: ⁴ Cornland smum·

is manured by grain, lupine, beans and vetches ’; just
as on the contrary ε ‘ Chick-pea‚ because it is pulled up
by the roots and because it is salt, barley‚fenugreek,
bitter vetch,—thesc all scorch up ⁶ a cornland, as do all
plants that are pulled up by the roots. Do not plant

stone-fruitd in corn-land.’—Virgil holds the opinion Geoqu. 77.

that cornland is also scorchcd by flax, oats and poppies.
