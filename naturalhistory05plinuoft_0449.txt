BOOK XIX. iv. 21—v1. 24

Among the poppies also there is a kind from which an
outstanding material for bleaching linen is extracted.
V. An attempt has been made to dye even linen
so as to adapt it for our mad extravagance in clothes.
This was first done in the fleets of Alexander the
Great when he was voyaging on the river Indus, his
generals and captains having held a sort of competi-
tion even in the various colours ofthe ensigns of their
ships3 and the river banks gazed in astonishment as
the breeze filled out the bunting with its shifting
hues. Cleopatra had a purple sail when she came
with Mark Antony to Actium, and with the same
sail she fled. A purple sail was subsequently the
distinguishing mark of the emperor’s ship.

VI. Linen cloths were used in the theatres as awn-
ings, a plan first invented by Quintus Catulus when
dedicating the Capitol. Next Lentulus Spinther is
recorded to have been the first to stretch awnings of
cambric in the theatre, at the gamos of Apollo. Soon
afterwards Caesar when dictator stretched awnings
over the whole of the Roman Forum, as well as the
Sacred W'ay from his mansion, and the slope right up
to the Capitol, a display recorded to have been thought
more wonderful even than the show of gladiator-s
which he gave. Next even when there was no display
of games Marcellus the son of Augustus's sister
Octavia, during his period of office as aedile, in the
eleventh consulship of his uncle, from the first of
August onward fixed awnings of sailcloth over the
forum, so that those engaged in lawsuits might resort
there under healthier conditions: what a change this
was from the stern manners of Cato the ρκ’-6611501, who
had expressed the view that even the forum ought
to be paved with sharp pointed stenes! ‘² Recently
